=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 15)

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.460
Why did Her Majesty suddenly give orders

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.660
for you and the Crown Princess
to get a divorce?

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.460
The envoys' visit

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.900
must have made her raise doubts.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.820
Shall we take the opportunity

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.140
to make a clear break
with the Crown Princess?

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.220
You're Crown Prince of Xuanhu City

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.620
and she's the Crown Princess of Huayuan City.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.420
Both of you are the future City Owners.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.420
You'll have to go back
to Xuanhu City sooner or later.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.220
The two of you are like the general
and the marshal on the Chinese chess board,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.460
who can't cross the River of the Chu
or the Border of the Han,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.340
let alone meet each other.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.660
What if I remove the boundary?

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.780
Do you mean

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.020
we'll conquer Huayuan City?

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.660
If the whole Chinese chess board is yours,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.780
then the Crown Princess

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.580
will definitely belong to you.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.580
Young Master,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.340
we're from Xuanhu City, anyway.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.860
Her Majesty has ordered

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.380
we should strengthen public security
now that Xuanhu City's envoys are here.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.700
Stay alert.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.700
Lord Han,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.580
we're doing this without
letting Young Master know.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.740
Will he punish us

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.180
if he knows about it?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.140
We're doing it under
the orders of the City Owner.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.460
Young Master also needs
to listen to his father.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.300
Got it.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.340
Be careful.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.740
It's all explosives inside.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.420
(The Annual Crowd Hunt of Huayuan City)

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.340
Qianqian,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.180
why does Han Shuo still stay in your mansion?

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.940
I've told you to divorce him.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.940
Mother,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.940
please give me more time.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.580
I don't know why you're into him.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.460
In terms of appearance,
moral quality or talent,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.740
Pei Heng is all superior.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.100
Well. It's not a beauty pageant.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.060
I really don't love Pei Heng.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.900
I can understand why Han Shuo
misunderstood me. You...

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.220
Your Majesty, let me pay my respects.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.140
You'd better not make trouble.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.700
Han Shuo,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.420
please take a seat.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.940
Qianqian.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.540
I'm going to give my regards to your mother.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.740
Go ahead.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.540
Qianqian.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.940
This year,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.060
you'll still get the most prey, right?

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.660
Why?

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.060
In previous years,

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.140
the Second Princess sent most of her prey

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.620
to your mansion.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.140
Yeah. Chuchu loves me most.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.340
Qianqian has been unruly
and self-willed since childhood

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.060
and Pei Heng is gentle and cultivated.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.340
He'll be the most tolerant one towards her.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.780
If the two of them get married,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.540
they'll be a happy couple

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.140
everyone admires.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.060
Pitifully...

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.100
Pitifully, Qianqian has married me.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.740
Han Shuo,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.540
men in Xuanhu are different
from those in Huayuan.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.940
In Xuanhu City, a woman is required to

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.460
obey her father before marriage, her husband
when married, and her sons in widowhood.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.860
In short, men are in authority over women.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.900
It's just the opposite in Huayuan.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.140
Here, men are appendages to women.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.380
Are you sure

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.700
you're willing to
become Qianqian's appendage?

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.940
Qianqian, don't feel awkward.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.380
I hope

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.300
we can get along as before.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.260
As

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.660
friends?

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.740
Can you try to persuade my mother?

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.340
Just tell her you regret it

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.700
and you don't want to marry me.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.500
She wouldn't listen to me.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.660
Only if you insist on refusing to marry me

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.580
can she give up that idea.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.940
What if I say

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.860
I don't want to reject it?

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.620
You just said

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.340
we could get along as friends.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.300
I also said I'd wait.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.940
Alright.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.260
I mean

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.020
I'll wait for the right time

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.300
to talk about it with your mother.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.140
Really?

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.740
You haven't come out hunting for a long time.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.020
Have a good time today.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.300
I...

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.820
I won't let this thing worry you.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.820
Thank you, Pei Heng.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.820
Qianqian and I love each other.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.580
I'm not an appendage to her and vice versa.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.020
You said you loved each other.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.500
How will you prove

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.060
your love for Qianqian?

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.900
You must have got an idea.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.020
According to rituals of Huayuan City,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.620
a princess's husband must wear

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.020
a copper bracelet with
the badge of the family

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.420
to prove that he belongs to her.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.140
He can't take it off as long as he lives.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.660
You want me to put on
the copper bracelet of Huayuan City?

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.060
Exactly.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.260
But in Xuanhu City,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.860
only servants and handymen will be labelled.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.260
Besides, as far as I'm concerned,

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.220
there hasn't been such
a ritual in Huayuan City.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.820
There is now.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.660
Starting from you.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.700
I believe

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.780
if it's Pei Heng,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.500
he'll say yes without hesitation.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.260
I'm wondering if you'll wear

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.340
a copper bracelet for Qianqian.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.300
What if I say no?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.500
Now that you refuse

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.660
to admit your relationship with Qianqian,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.060
why bother staying married?

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.380
How about

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.420
ending your marriage?

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.460
You're pushing me

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.060
to let it go first.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.140
Han Shuo,

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.860
think about it.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.220
Your Highness,

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.940
I wonder what the Crown Princess said

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.900
to Mr. Su.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.980
He hasn't been here for several days.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.580
They say

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.340
male entertainers are heartless.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.620
It's really the case.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.500
Su Mu is not that kind of person.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.500
Mother.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.740
Yuanyuan.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.540
Chuchu.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.980
Qianqian, you're here.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.420
Let's have a discussion.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.540
The Double Seventh Festival is approaching.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.580
I plan to pick a gentle and kind man

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.700
to be Yuanyuan's husband.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.620
Mother, don't worry about me.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.020
These days,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.900
I always felt exhausted.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.060
I'm feeling my age.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.740
I can't always stay by your side.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.500
So, I want to see all of you get married

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.180
in my remaining years.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.180
Chuchu,

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.260
when Yuanyuan is married,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.300
it'll be your turn.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.500
Me? But I...

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.420
But Chuchu has fallen in love with Han Shuo.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.860
Mother,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.980
you'd better pick a guy for Chuchu first.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.580
I'm not interested.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.420
Forget about it.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.060
I'd better get Yuanyuan
and Su Mu's issue done first.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.740
Yuanyuan,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.100
you're afraid you can't
pick the right guy, right?

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.180
I've got an idea.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.580
Let's throw an embroidered ball.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.980
Throw an embroidered ball?

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.660
Yuanyuan, trust me.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.940
I have 1,000 ways

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.500
to make sure Su Mu gets the ball.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.900
He won't show up.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.820
Don't you want to give it a try?

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.220
If he shows up,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.180
it means he likes you too.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.700
Trust me.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.500
At this Double Seventh Festival,

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.860
there is no smoke of gunpowder

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.620
but ebullition of joy.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.020
The rabbit is so cute.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.540
It'll be tasty if we use it to
make Spicy Diced Rabbit.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.060
Go pick it up.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.740
Where are you?

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.780
Mr. Rabbit.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.180
I'm sorry.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.260
Chuchu is such a good archer.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.580
Do you want to be braised or steamed,

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.140
or become Spicy Diced Rabbit?

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.540
Let's go.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.460
Chuchu, one rabbit is enough.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.220
I'm leaving if there is nothing else to do.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.540
Han Shuo, you're a good archer.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.260
Second Princess, you're a better one.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.980
Pitifully, I missed it.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.540
I'm wondering what you want.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.460
We're hunting. Of course, I want my prey.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.700
But Chen Qianqian is your younger sister.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.420
She has long stopped
treating me as her sister.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.860
Why do I need to consider her as mine?

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.940
It seems you were not drunk

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.740
that evening.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.540
Han Shuo,

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.460
now that my mother has
ordered Qianqian to divorce you,

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.900
I can beg her

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.900
to let you marry me.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.940
I'll only stay with Chen Qianqian this life.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.220
But it's obvious

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.980
Chen Qianqian doesn't like you at all.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.740
She's always changeable and self-willed.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.620
I've seen too much about
that since my childhood.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.460
She's going to abandon you

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.740
and marry Pei Heng.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.900
Why do you still have illusions
about her feelings for you?

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.540
It seems you don't know Qianqian well.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.940
And you know even less about me.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.860
Are you so dead set on following her?

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.060
If you aim at Qianqian again,

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.860
I'll shoot

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.260
my second arrow.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.380
Sooner or later,

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.900
you'll know she doesn't deserve it.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:52.980
I shot this rabbit for you.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.420
How will you cook it?

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.180
Miss Lin Qi, I don't eat rabbit.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.580
Take it back.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.060
Chen Qianqian.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.060
Why are you here?

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.060
Qianqian,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.580
are you here to take a rabbit to me?

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.460
There is something you don't know.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.380
Minister Pei doesn't eat rabbit.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.540
I do.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.660
You just told me you didn't.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.660
Su Mu, put the rabbit away.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.540
Did you decide to eat it

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.900
just because it's from her?

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.140
Chen Qianqian,

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.220
you've made him

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.340
a topic of conversation for the whole city.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.820
How dare you come here and...

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.620
You!

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.940
I have something to say to you.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.620
Chen Qianqian!

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.740
Su Mu,

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.020
why did you not help Yuanyuan

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.540
with her rehabilitation recently?

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.820
You promised me

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.300
you'd take care of her.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.620
Zi Nian always stays by her side.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.980
I'm not irreplaceable.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.740
It's not all about rehabilitation.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.380
The two of you care about each other.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.820
Why don't you take the opportunity

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.860
to spend more time with her?

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.060
Your Highness, please don't say that.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.300
I'm a man of low origin. How dare I do that?

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.060
If others know about it,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.780
the Princess Royal will be discredited.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.180
Your Highness,

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.900
please don't mention this issue again.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.100
If you don't tell her how you feel about her,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.260
how can she be determined
to throw an embroidered ball?

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.580
Mealtime.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.500
Anybody? Guards! Someone broke out of prison!

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.180
(Xingzi Mansion)

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.700
Come out!

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.420
Your Highness.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.460
Su Ziying?

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.500
I'm here to assist you.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.780
Assist me?

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.140
Haven't you been imprisoned?

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.100
How did you escape?

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.260
Chen Qianqian is infamous.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.860
She doesn't deserve to
be the future City Owner.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.180
Your Highness, don't you want to replace her

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.380
and enjoy the highest position

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.980
and supreme power?

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.380
She's been elected as the Crown Princess.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.860
It has nothing to do with me.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.220
It all depends on
human effort, Your Highness.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.660
I'm confident that

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.860
I can help you

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.580
become the Crown Princess.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.740
While you worked for Chen Qianqian,

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.180
you reported she illegally
possessed the defense map

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.220
and tried to rebel.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.260
And in the end,

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.820
instead of getting her into trouble,

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.700
you were thrown into prison.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.140
What can you do

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.940
to be my aide?

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.660
I've got some secret information.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.420
The envoys of Xuanhu City

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.940
have taken lots of explosives here.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.500
They'll launch an attack

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.420
in the evening of
the Double Seventh Festival.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.700
Do you have evidence?

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.140
I got this tip-off by accident

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.500
in Chen Qianqian's mansion

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.580
when I worked for her.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.900
If you believe me,

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.660
you can take the opportunity
to arrest Han Shuo

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.420
and use it as an excuse
to accuse Chen Qianqian

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.300
so that she will be dethroned.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.060
If you don't believe me,

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.100
you can throw me into prison again.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.380
Why do you want to help me?

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.940
Your Highness, do you really forget me?

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.980
How dare you try to be hired as a lieutenant

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.500
by pretending to be a girl.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.420
I'll beat you to death.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.060
I'll beat you to death.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.660
Qianqian, stop it.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.740
Your Highness.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.740
Are you okay?

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.060
I'll take you to the doctor.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.900
You were the one who stopped Chen Qianqian

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.140
and saved my life.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.220
You also let me heal
my wounds at the Pei's Mansion.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:46.940
At that time,

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.580
I made a promise that I'd pay you back.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.180
Thinking back carefully,

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.060
I did do this thing.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.580
I admire you from the bottom of my heart.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.820
I'll remain loyal to you.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.700
You just said

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.340
Han Shuo and the envoys

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.180
had arranged troops
in ambush and laid explosives.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.300
Yes, Your Highness.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.740
As long as you prove

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.420
Han Shuo intends to conquer Huayuan City,

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.020
you'll be able to turn the tables.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.900
In this case,

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.220
Han Shuo will definitely lose his life.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.580
But you'll become
the Crown Princess with ease.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.020
I serve as the Minister of Defense,

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.220
but I couldn't move City Guards
without letting my mother know.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.500
How can I cope with Han Shuo

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.020
while hiding it from her?

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.660
There is one family in the city

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.140
whose security guards
are brave and battle-wise.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.100
Do you mean the Pei family?

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.540
Pei Heng will help me?

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.780
(Pei's Mansion)

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.420
I've already messed up once.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.140
If I fail again this time,

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.780
I'll never win my mother's trust back.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:44.980
Minister Pei,

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.220
this is a secret action,

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.100
so I have to ask you for a favor.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.340
Borrow soldiers?

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.100
Your Highness, as the Minister of Defense,

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.980
you can move troops anytime.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.220
Why do you want to borrow my security guards?

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.020
You said

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.820
Han Shuo intended to conquer Huayuan City.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.580
Do you have evidence?

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.500
I've investigated Xuanhu's envoys in secret

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.100
and confirmed the information is correct.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.220
I've marked the locations

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.740
where explosives have been laid.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.900
To avoid alerting the enemy,

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.540
I'm afraid I can't provide more evidence.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.980
Minister Pei,

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.260
as for this matter,

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.940
it's better to err on the side of caution.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.620
You also want to prove to Qianqian that

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.100
Han Shuo has an ulterior motive, right?

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.100
As long as we join hands,

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.380
Han Shuo's plan will be destroyed

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.380
and Qianqian will awaken to the truth.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.940
Why not do it?

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.140
It's about the defense of the city.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.460
I have to report it to the City Owner.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.300
Don't you hope that

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.580
Qianqian can't find any excuse to refuse you?

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.500
If I lend soldiers to you,

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.860
do you have confidence
that you can catch Han Shuo?

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.020
Young Master Han, if you're ready,

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.180
I'll ask the blacksmith to get started.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.700
I have to make things clear beforehand.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.260
The bracelet is like shackles.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.660
Once it's welded,

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.020
it's impossible to take it off
without leaving serious injuries.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.380
Will the City Owner recall the order

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.340
and never mention Qianqian's
engagement to Pei Heng

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.980
as long as I accept the humiliation?

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.740
Please mind your language.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.820
How can you consider
the badge of Huayuan City

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.620
as a humiliation?

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.500
If you're unwilling to do that,

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.460
just tell the City Owner

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.900
you agree to divorce the Crown Princess.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.020
Do you want to scald him to death?

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.340
Stop there.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.420
What a coincidence.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.620
Tomorrow is the Double Seventh Festival.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:52.780
You want to ask me to go out?

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.580
I'm busy tomorrow.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.740
I need to arrange my mother's
inspection on a festooned vehicle

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.420
and help Yuanyuan with the ceremony
of throwing an embroidered ball.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.460
I really have no time left.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.260
Enjoy yourself tomorrow.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.180
I have something to say to you.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.180
No matter what you want to say,

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.580
wait till the day after tomorrow.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.620
I'm going back.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.180
Can't you let me finish my words?

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.420
Why do you keep avoiding me?

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.580
Why do you always brush me off?

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.740
Why do you pay no attention to how I feel?

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.300
You made me

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.220
feel so worthless.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.100
Your mother asked you to divorce me.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.980
You haven't given me an explanation.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.460
Everyone wants us to get a divorce,

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.140
but I insist on staying with you like a fool.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.020
If you treat me like that,

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.340
how could I persuade myself to keep going?

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.660
Then give up.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.380
♪It seems all I have wished for.♪

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.900
What did you say?

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.740
Repeat it.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.220
All you know is scaring me

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.380
and threatening me.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.380
I threaten you?

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.100
It turns out I became the one

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.140
♪While we are still young?♪

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.500
who forced you to marry me.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.020
♪Life is sweet as long as you're with me.♪

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:30.820
♪I hope the dream can come true.♪

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.100
You're free to go.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:47.700
Young Master.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.420
Young Master, you asked us to come here

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.900
because you've changed your mind, right?

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.540
Now that you've laid explosives

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.940
all over the city behind my back,

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.900
I have no choice but to do this.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.740
Okay. Great.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.500
These are all the locations with explosives?

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.980
Young Master, don't worry.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.700
Nothing will go wrong.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.340
Only when you are one-up

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.260
can you get everything you want,

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.580
including Chen Qianqian.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.580
Slow down.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.380
Awesome!

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.660
(Music and Dance Academy)

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.820
These musicians the Music and Dance Academy
just bought

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.100
are not bad.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.260
Exactly.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.020
Let's go.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.300
Isn't that Lu Peng?

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.500
Has he been back?

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.540
Now that Su Mu has left the Academy,

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.940
Lu Peng will be the best musician here.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.220
Of course, he chose to come back.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.540
Stop looking.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.020
The best is yet to come.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:40.540
Really?

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.020
The Princess Royal will
throw an embroidered ball.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:42.980
Whoever catches it

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.460
will marry her.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.460
That's exciting.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:45.980
Let's go.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:46.940
Okay.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.580
Is Su Mu there?

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:16.740
Throw it.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.380
Crown Princess.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.580
Throw it. Crown Princess.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.460
Crown Princess.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.340
Crown Princess, Su Mu hasn't shown up.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.060
Will this really work?

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.060
It just started. No hurry.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.620
I've sent for him.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.420
Even if he comes,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.580
how do you guarantee he can catch the ball?

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.340
Trust me. Yuanyuan,
I've got everything arranged.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.620
Zi Rui.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.020
Here.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:50.780
In a while,

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.660
I'll approach Su Mu

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.260
with this embroidered ball.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.860
You need to pose like you're
going to throw the ball,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:55.820
but don't really do it.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.780
Cover it with your sleeve like this

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.100
and people will think you've thrown it.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.580
Then I'll pass this ball

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.740
to Su Mu in secret.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.820
Nobody will find it out.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.100
Does it really work?

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.660
Yes. Definitely. It's...

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.220
It's called editing thinking.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.860
Let me show you.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.020
I got it!

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.300
Got it?

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.500
Just show them

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.140
how you pose to throw an embroidered ball

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.100
and how Su Mu poses to catch it.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.900
Then everyone will think you've thrown a ball

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.660
and Su Mu has caught it.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:27.780
That's it.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.020
Okay!

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.140
There he is. Mr. Su is there.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.300
Mr. Su is there.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.300
Hurry.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.900
The Princess Royal shows up.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.380
He's really there.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.860
Princess Royal.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.740
Yuanyuan, I'm going down to see Su Mu.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.460
Look carefully.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.020
Throw the embroidered ball

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:11.940
after I'm by Su Mu's side.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:12.620
Don't do it

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.660
before that.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.660
Got it?

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.500
Got it.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.580
We've been waiting so long.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.820
Princess Royal.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.460
Isn't that Su Mu?

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.220
Is he also there to catch
the embroidered ball?

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.540
He's just a musician.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.940
The Princess Royal is out of his league.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.780
Maybe he's just here as a looker-on.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.020
The Princess Royal is a cripple.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.180
Why is she out of his league?

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.580
Su Mu is the best musician, anyway.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.780
Maybe the Princess Royal
just deserves a musician

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.820
now that she's a cripple.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:58.660
Unbelievable.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.700
Yeah.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.540
Nothing is impossible.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.900
Even Young Master Han
wears a copper bracelet.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.140
Usually, only the underclass and servants

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.500
wear that thing.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.980
Young Master of Xuanhu is just so so.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.940
What bracelet were you talking about?

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.140
Crown Princess, it has spread the whole city

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.900
that Han Shuo was ordered by the City Owner

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.060
to wear a copper bracelet

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.220
to prove he belongs to you.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.580
It means women of Huayuan City

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.780
can enslave men of Xuanhu City.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:27.780
Wearing a bracelet?

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.740
I didn't write it.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.940
Everyone wants us to get a divorce,

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.580
but I insist on staying with you like a fool.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.980
If you treat me like that,

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.620
how could I persuade myself to keep going?

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.860
Han Shuo.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:51.700
Han Shuo.

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.700
Crown Princess. Have a rest.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.940
Where is Han Shuo?

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.700
Han Shuo?

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.740
I haven't seen him the whole day.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.860
Where has he gone?

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.220
Don't worry.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.220
We'll find him.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.540
I shouldn't have refused him yesterday.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.660
He's so proud and arrogant.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.140
He must be heartbroken.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.260
It's all my fault.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:11.980
If it hadn't been for me,

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.500
he couldn't have put on that damned bracelet.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.060
I let him down time and again.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.180
Bracelet?

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.860
Young Master Han put on a bracelet?

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.660
Uh. Don't be sad.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.580
I don't think

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.740
Young Master Han will take it to heart.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.060
Well, this morning,

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.900
I saw Bai Ji and Young Master Han

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.220
ordering guys from Xuanhu City

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.820
to move a lot of boxes.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.740
Bai Ji told me

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.420
Young Master Han would give you

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.820
a big surprise tonight.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.060
He said, after tonight,

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.820
you would regret

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.220
you treated Young Master Han like that.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.740
They asked me not to tell you

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.020
because they're afraid
you won't feel surprised.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.580
They've prepared special
local products of Xuanhu City.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.860
Zi Rui,

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.220
do you know what Xuanhu City abounds in?

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.260
Fruit?

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:56.620
Ironware?

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.300
What is it?

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.140
Explosives.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.340
The boxes are filled with explosives.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.100
After being pushed by
my mother and refused by me,

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.380
he wants to bomb Huayuan.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.900
Xuanhu will destroy Huayuan.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.820
Crown Princess, don't run.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.100
Crown Princess, where are you going?

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.180
The embroidered ball.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.540
Right. The embroidered ball.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.340
Zi Rui, keep the embroidered ball.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.740
Don't give it to anyone except Su Mu.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.900
I have to find Han Shuo.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.300
You lead a team respectively and split up.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:30.900
Got it.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.220
Your Highness,

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:33.740
our guys are

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.500
lying in ambush at places

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.500
where explosives have been laid.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.380
It seems you don't know Qianqian well.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.180
And you know even less about me.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.300
If you aim at Qianqian again,

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.500
I'll shoot

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.620
my second arrow.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.700
Once Han Shuo takes action,

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.180
arrest him at once.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.500
Try your best to capture him alive.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.420
Yes, Your Highness.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.620
When Han Shuo is convicted,

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:01.900
he'll be at your disposal.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.220
Chuchu.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.740
Chuchu.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.860
Crown Princess, you can't go in.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.340
Chuchu.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.140
Go away!

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.220
Chuchu, there is an urgency.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.660
Only you can help me.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.780
What can I do for you?

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.260
As the Crown Princess, you're awe-inspiring.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.700
You even broke into my house

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.780
without permission.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.020
Han Shuo wants to conquer Huayuan City.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.500
Send City Guards to find him.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.340
We must stop him.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.140
How did you know that?

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.940
There is no time to lose.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.580
Han Shuo had explosives
laid in the whole city.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.420
Mother's inspection tour is about to start.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.580
Once the explosives are ignited...

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.740
He won't have his way.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.180
I've sent guys to lie in ambush

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.780
at every place with explosives.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.700
You've already known that?

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.060
You've not only known that,

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.340
but also sent guys to catch him.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.660
Han Shuo harbors evil designs.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.900
As the Minister of Defense,

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.380
I have to arrest him.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.700
To convict someone,
you must catch him red-handed.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.740
I'll give him a deadly blow tonight.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.980
Catch him red-handed?

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.900
You knew what he was going to do today.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.140
Why did you not stop him?

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.100
Instead, you want to see
him make big trouble.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:02.900
Chen Chuchu,

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.780
to become the Crown Princess,

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.140
you even decided to give up Han Shuo?

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.140
You don't have the right to yell at me.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.220
Why does Han Shuo want to conquer Huayuan?

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.940
Isn't it because you keep changing your mind

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.500
and have so many love affairs?

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.860
Chuchu, stop it.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.340
Don't make things difficult for Qianqian.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.700
Pei Heng,

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.700
you can help me, right?

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.460
Go find him and stop him.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.860
As the son of the former Minister of Defense,

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.380
you can help me out.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.780
Why does he have to do that?

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.660
Today is the Double Seventh Festival.

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.300
City Guards need to patrol the whole city

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.620
and protect our mother.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.140
Why don't you have a guess?

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.620
Who lent me soldiers

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.580
to encircle and suppress Han Shuo?

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.420
Fine.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.940
Neither of you is obliged to help me,

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.420
but I can't do nothing

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.220
while watching you give up on Han Shuo.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.340
Now that you don't go,

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.180
I'll go alone.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.340
I can stop Han Shuo by myself.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.300
Guards!

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.420
Now that you're here, you'd better stay.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.740
I'll keep our mother company.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.220
Just stay here.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.620
I'll deal with you later.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.660
Chen Chuchu,

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.460
didn't you say you wanted Han Shuo?

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.060
Pei Heng.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.300
Don't look at me like that.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.380
I know you're not that type of person.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.300
You couldn't hurt others.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.180
When will she throw it?

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:04.780
Come on.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:05.660
When will she do it?

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:06.260
Is she going to do it or not?

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.700
It's an important event in her life.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.300
It's understandable she's cautious.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.940
I've been waiting for two hours.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.820
If it goes on like this, it'll be dawn.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.780
Is she going to throw it or not?

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.980
Mr. Su is back.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.820
It's not Mr. Su.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:25.660
Hurry up.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.500
He won't show up again.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.580
Excuse me.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.060
Excuse me.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.940
Help me with it.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:41.900
Guo,

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.380
did you see Mr. Su?

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.260
No.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.620
What does he look like?

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.500
Your Highness, how about
you don't throw it today?

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.660
Let's go back.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.140
They all want to make a decision for me.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.500
I'm a cripple,

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.020
so I even don't have the right

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.140
to decide who I can marry?

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.020
No. I'll throw it.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.420
Why do I have to give up
just because he doesn't show up?

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.420
Pass the ball to me.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.820
Your Highness.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.620
Pass it to me.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:52.900
Your Highness.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.580
Her Majesty has left her mansion

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.220
on the festooned vehicle.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.380
We've missed the auspicious time.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.540
How about we don't do it today?

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.500
Let's go back.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.420
Guo, the Crown Princess

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.740
asked the Princess Royal not
to throw the embroidered ball

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.260
unless Mr. Su shows up.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.140
Wait here.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.180
I'll go stop her.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.060
Your Highness, throw it!

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.100
Here. Your Highness.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.140
Look. She threw it.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:30.820
She threw it.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:31.820
It's here.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.740
Here. It's mine.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.620
The ball.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.860
Meng Guo, get the ball!

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:39.940
It's mine.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.700
Mine.

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:42.620
It'll be mine.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.220
Stop pushing.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.420
I got it!

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.740
Where is it?

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.140
Don't grab.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.900
Who dares to grab?

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.700
You? You?

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.020
He got the embroidered ball.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.420
He'll be the Princess Royal's husband.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.700
It's him.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:11.620
I can't believe he got it.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.460
A musician.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.340
He's a musician.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.300
A musician.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.260
I can't believe it.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.980
Your Highness,

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.380
he's the one who got the embroidered ball.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.220
Your Highness, let me pay my respects.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:31.860
Tell everyone

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.020
he'll be my husband now that
he got the embroidered ball.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.140
I'm determined to marry a musician.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:39.420
Got it.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:44.860
Your Majesty!

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.380
I'll look for Han Shuo with you,

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.540
but you have to promise me

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.220
this is your last time
being bewitched by him.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.500
You can't believe him again

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.740
no matter what he says.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.820
I'll stop him.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.180
I won't let him do that.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.620
No way. We couldn't find him
if it goes on like this.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.060
We'd better get off
the horse and act separately.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.100
Here.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.940
I heard you were looking everywhere for me.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.060
Where did you go?

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.180
I've been looking for you so long.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.500
I did something great.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.380
Your timing is perfect.
I was planning to look for you.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.900
Even if you didn't want to see me,

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.260
I'd tie you up and take you there.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.060
The City Owner is here!

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:40.980
Mother.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.780
Mother.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.140
Qianqian.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:43.940
Mother.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.340
I'll show you something interesting.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.420
Wait. Han Shuo.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.580
It's my fault.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.220
I shouldn't have ignored you.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.820
I shouldn't have brushed you off.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.380
I shouldn't have pushed you away.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.420
I promise I won't do that again.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.220
Han Shuo, I like you.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.900
I really like you.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.500
I want to stay with you.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.340
I'll stay with you

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.900
no matter who wants to stop me.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.260
Why are you saying these silly words?

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.300
I know I let you down.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.220
You even suffered this for me.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.500
It couldn't be taken off, right?

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.460
It can't as long as you live, right?

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.780
I don't think it's a badge of Huayuan City.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:46.420
I think...

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.100
... it's you.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.060
You're a rose with thorns.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.340
Wearing a rose doesn't make me suffer.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.140
You hurt me

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.620
with your thorns,

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:01.980
but I

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.220
love it.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.020
I'll stay here

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.780
for you.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.220
I'll stay by your side all my life.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.900
For my sake,

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:25.980
can you stop...

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.260
Your Majesty!

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.900
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.220
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.900
