=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 6)

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.300
Drink the Dragon Bone soup.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.140
Drink it immediately.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.740
Otherwise, it will become stinkier when it's cold.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.180
Qianqian stole Dragon Bone for Han Shuo.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.420
It seems she really loves him.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.100
But till now

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.060
they haven't slept together.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.300
Could Qianqian be blamed?

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.140
Han Shuo is an ambitious man.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.860
I was so careless.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.980
I think he just want to use Qianqian

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.300
to steal the Dragon Bone.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.700
But...

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.060
But just now Young Master Han

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.260
fed the first spoon of Dragon Bone soup

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.580
to Her Highness.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.500
He just pretended to be nice.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.020
At last, the Dragon Bone soup

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.860
was drunk up by him.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.740
He is the first person

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.340
who dared to play tricks under my eyes.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.300
I will turn Han Shuo

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.820
into an ordinary person again.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.740
Then, how about Her Highness?

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.100
If I must raise a dog,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.420
I will raise an obedient dog.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.180
Good morning, Young Master Han.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.780
I heard that you had drunk Dragon Bone soup.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.780
I just sent this good news to Xuanhu City.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.220
I never thought that people
from Xuanhu City could know it.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.140
It is my pleasure to meet you.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.940
Minister Yang.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.500
I must say that you're very thoughtful.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.260
Thanks to a firework show
at the Third Princess's Mansion last night,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.740
I found that the Second Princess was tracing me.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.340
So I could find this chance to meet you.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.180
The firework show last night

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.620
was not my idea.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.060
I am not that smart.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.020
You're so humble.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.740
Now, you have got rid of your heart disease.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.460
We are halfway to success.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.940
Next, when a chance arises,

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.100
our well-equipped troops will move southward

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.660
and conquer Huayuan City.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.780
The black stone mine of Huayuan City

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.380
will become Hu's.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.740
Minister Yang is a woman.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.580
Wouldn't you be happier
if you stay in Huayuan City?

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.660
Why do you want to work for me?

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.460
Though I am in Huayuan City,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.660
I concern about families of Xuanhu City.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.620
I wish to do everything for you.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.180
If that is so,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.540
could you do me a favor?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.140
Please tell me.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.220
In future, if anyone
argues about the Third Princess,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.180
please defend her

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.340
and protect her.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.380
I don't want Qianqian
to fall into any trouble again.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.820
Yes.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.980
Your Highness.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.660
We had better report to Her Majesty.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.100
Our mission failed last night.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.260
If my mother knows it,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.180
she will think that I am useless.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.000
But your wound is severe.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.380
Perhaps if Her Majesty sees your wound,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.900
she will not blame you.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.660
My mother took care of Qianqian
at Yueli Mansion all night yesterday.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.580
Please don't bother her.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.180
I heard the Third Princess went to Ancestral Hall
and grabbed the Dragon Bone away.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.260
She cured the heart disease
of Young Master Han.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.060
In the past,
only Her Majesty and the Crown Princess

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.220
know the whereabouts of the Dragon Bone.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.020
How did the Third Princess know that

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.020
the Dragon Bone was hidden at Ancestral Hall?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.060
Has Her Majesty
decided to pass the throne to...

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.940
Zi Zhu.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.700
Don't be suspicious without reason.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.620
There must be something we don't know.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.260
I guess that Qianqian

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.500
found the Dragon Bone by chance.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.900
She fired fireworks
at the mansion last night.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.100
Is that a coincidence too?

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.860
She also made you severely injured.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.060
What are you watching?

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.540
This is a serial drama.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.900
Don't think that stealing
a Dragon Bone is all I want to do.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.860
I still want to do other things.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.020
What are those things?

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.300
Is everything ready?

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.380
Young Master, please rest assured.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.940
I don't know if she likes to eat it.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.380
It is expensive.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.580
Where did my Kung Fu go?

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.380
I am a worthless person.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.780
What should I do?

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.780
I never heard that Soul Missing Powder
has such a side effect.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.100
Qianqian.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.540
Qianqian, what is wrong with you?

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.860
After I was poisoned,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.500
I found myself
losing the ability of fighting.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.940
I will be

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.740
a worthless person forever.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.580
My mother will set up
a Kung Fu contest for me.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.700
But I can't attend it anymore.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.340
Come on.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.220
How do you feel now?

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.980
Hope

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:57.820
-less.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.060
How strange! I want to eat pomegranates.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.780
There should be
no pomegranates in this season.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.140
That's right.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.860
A person without Kung Fu

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.420
doesn't deserve to eat pomegranates.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.820
Bai Ji, go to buy pomegranates.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.620
Yes, sir.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.660
Young Master, pomegranates.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.260
Pomegranates.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.620
I just want to see if they are available.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.540
Now I am relieved.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.940
I don't have appetite.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.380
I can't eat now.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.100
Take away.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.900
Han Shuo.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.980
Why don't I write a letter

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.860
to dissolve our marriage contract?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.460
You can seek refuge with Chen Chuchu.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.660
No. You...

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.580
I am a commoner already.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.380
Everyone supports Chuchu.
She will have a bright future.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.540
She can protect you.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.100
The Second Princess is severely injured.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.980
She is not well.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.100
What's wrong with her?

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.180
Who dared to

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.100
injure her? Bastard!

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.620
The Second Princess was conducting
a secret mission that night.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.460
It was agreed that fireworks
should be the signal for action.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.700
But someone fired fireworks in advance.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.340
We don't know who that person is.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.900
The secret mission
of the Second Princess was unveiled.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.260
So she fought with enemies.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.900
Why did fireworks hurt Chuchu?

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.420
The lighting of fireworks

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.060
perhaps was an accident.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.940
Young Master Han should consider

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.980
Chuchu...

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.580
I will not leave you.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.260
Your Highness should take a rest.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.300
If there is anything you want,

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.140
please ask me.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.500
Go.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.940
I will teach you a lesson.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.820
They have gone.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.580
He refused to leave.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.500
Fine.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.620
I will find another chance

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.300
to send him to Chuchu in the future.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.980
He will not stay
with a good-for-nothing forever.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.500
To save my life,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.540
I have already used up
my strength and acting skills.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.420
Pomegranates.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.020
Your Highness.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.860
Lord Sangqi is dispatching
an order of Her Majesty.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.420
Dispatching an order?

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.900
What is the order?

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.540
By the order of Her Majesty...

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.940
Take care.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.260
The Crown Prince of Xuanhu City Han Shuo

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.900
coaxed the Third Princess Chen Qianqian
to steal the Dragon Bone.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.340
It is decreed that a bone
should be taken from Han Shuo,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.860
so as to ensure a correct understanding
of the matter and give peace to the people.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.260
Take what?

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.860
Don't move.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.660
Han Shuo.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.100
Han Shuo. Let me go.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.140
Han Shuo.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.220
Let me go. Han Shuo.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.780
Sangqi.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:15.860
Your Highness.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.300
After you stole the Dragon Bone,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.060
civilians and officials in the city

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.020
all wanted the justice to be served.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.180
That's why Her Majesty came up this idea.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.260
She only wants to protect you.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:24.860
I...

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.220
The City Owner is coming.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.340
That can't be true.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.460
I brought a big trouble to Han Shuo.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:50.780
Let me go.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.260
Mother.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.140
Mother.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.060
Mother. Why are you doing this?

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.380
Because Han Shuo drank up Dragon Bone soup,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.300
he damaged the fortune of Huayuan City.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.260
I am the City Owner of Huayuan City.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.420
I will take a bone from his body

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.660
to assuage the people's anger.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.060
Take a bone?

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.780
How big should be the bone?

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.500
Is this big enough?

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.860
Silly girl.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.660
That is depend on
the size of the Dragon Bone.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:15.900
Guards.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.580
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.460
Take a rib from Han Shuo's body.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.900
Don't do that.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.020
Don't do that. Han Shuo.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.180
Let me go.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.660
Han Shuo.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.060
Don't approach him.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.940
Han Shuo.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.140
Mother.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.140
Han Shuo.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.860
Han Shuo.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.780
Han Shuo.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.180
Mother.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.500
Mother. I beg you. Mother.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.580
Let me go.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.740
Han Shuo.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.140
Go away.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.740
Go away. Go away.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.620
Mother. Mother.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.180
I stole the Dragon Bone alone.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.380
It has nothing to do with Han Shuo.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.380
If you take a rib from his body,

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.700
he will be either disabled or died.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.220
Mother. Han Shuo is a proud man.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.540
You had better kill him than disable him.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.300
Killing him is better.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.580
Without his coaxing,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.620
you would not make such a big trouble.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.180
Do you know what people say nowadays?

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.740
You have become a bane of civilians.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.180
Don't move.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.460
Mother.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.380
I will bear all the consequences.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.500
I forced Han Shuo to drink Dragon Bone soup.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.140
If you want to take a bone, take my bone.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.500
I am his rib.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.780
Don't move.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.300
Drag Chen Qianqian away.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.580
Please don't. Please don't.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.140
Han Shuo. Han Shuo.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:34.860
Your Highness.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.900
Han Shuo. Wake up.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.060
Han Shuo. Han Shuo. Wake up.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.940
If you don't wake up,
I can't protect you. Han Shuo.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.060
Separate them.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.100
Please don't. Please don't.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.300
Mother.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.100
You don't know

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.340
how important Han Shuo is to me?

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.620
Let me go.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.100
Pull her away. Pull her away.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.460
Han Shuo. Wake up.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.700
All right.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.060
You can take my bone.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.460
I know you don't dare to do that.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.820
Mother.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.180
You can punish me if you wish.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.540
Drag Chen Qianqian away.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.780
I know you will not hurt me.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.580
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.340
I am not.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.580
I am ashamed of you.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.420
Drag her away.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.100
Please don't.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:20.980
Please don't.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.900
Han Shuo.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.660
Qianqian.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.300
Han Shuo. You have woken up.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:27.980
Qianqian.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:28.780
Han Shuo. You have woken up.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.820
I will not release my hands.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.380
If I release my hands, they will hurt you.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.460
Han Shuo.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.660
Han Shuo. Sorry.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.180
I don't know things
will turn out to be like this.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.540
I just wanted to cure your heart disease.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.260
But I never thought
that you would be punished for my mistake.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.860
You are pressing my wound.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:49.900
Besides,

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.260
if you keep hugging me like this,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.420
I will not be able to use my Kung Fu.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.980
Do you want to know

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.380
how powerful I am after

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.900
I was cured by you?

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.540
Han Shuo. Han Shuo.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.860
Don't hurt him.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.260
Don't hurt him.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.860
Don't hurt him.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.620
Who dares to hurt her?

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.380
Nobody wants to hurt her.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.500
We just want to hurt you.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.340
Let Her Highness go.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.420
Please don't cry.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.900
I am alright.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.300
Sorry.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.740
It is my fault.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.860
If you keep crying,

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.220
I will get a heart disease again.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.780
How can it be possible?

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.500
The Dragon Bone I stole is real.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.980
Is it true if you take a bone from my body,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.220
you will never blame Qianqian

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.900
for stealing the Dragon Bone?

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.180
Please do it.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.460
You are crazy.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.580
You will lose so much blood
and your wound will get infected.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.020
Eventually you will die.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.940
Please don't blame Qianqian anymore.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.540
Do you really want to risk your life

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.140
for Qianqian?

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.340
Let's calm down.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.420
I think that there should be other options.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.940
You don't understand how important
the Dragon Bone means to civilians.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.980
You stole the Dragon Bone

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.340
to cure my heart disease.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.980
I must be punished.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.660
Then you can be exonerated.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.500
Qianqian.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.220
You are a princess of the city.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.860
People call you the Third Princess.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.660
You have to shoulder

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.140
your responsibility.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.060
Princess.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.140
Is that mean if I was not a princess,

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.580
I would not shoulder any responsibility?

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.260
Do you know what you are talking about?

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.220
Mother.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.140
I am not good
at either literature or Kung Fu.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.540
I am a good-for-nothing.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.340
Please abolish my title
and let me be a commoner.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.140
I will not be

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.980
the Third Princess anymore.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.980
Nonsense.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.820
You are my daughter.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.660
How can you refuse to be a princess?

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.940
Your Majesty. It looks that Her Highness

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.340
loves Young Master Han very much.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.860
If we don't make a compromise,

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.980
I am afraid that it will
be harder for Her Highness

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.500
to handle the situation.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.420
Qianqian.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.020
Do you know what will become of you

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.980
if you are a commoner?

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.140
Han Shuo will stay with me.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.860
I am not afraid.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.940
Do you really trust me?

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.980
By the order of Her Majesty,
(City Owner's Mansion)

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.580
Chen Qianqian, the daughter of
City Owner, is stubborn and disobedient.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.700
Disregarding ancestral traditions,

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.380
she stole the Dragon Bone
and damaged the fortune of the city.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.740
Therefore, it is decreed
that she should become a ccommoner

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.740
and be deprived of any special rights.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.260
She should go back
to the mansion to reflect on her mistakes.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.980
Without being summoned by Her Majesty,

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.580
she should not leave the mansion.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.900
Isn't the Third Princess
the most favorite daughter of Her Majesty?

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.940
Why was she deprived of the title?

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.380
I am so surprised.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.460
Now how should we read

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.620
the announcement
about punishing the Third Princess?

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.900
Her Majesty has gained
the upper hand by taking the initiative.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.100
Since the Third Princess has become a commoner,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.780
shall we wind up

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.420
the case of stealing the Dragon Bone?

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.660
I agree.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.180
Then the Crown Princess will be...

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.820
OK. Dismiss.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.380
(Pei's Mansion)

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.140
Minister Pei.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.780
I heard that

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.260
because the Third Princess stole the Dragon Bone,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.300
she had been deprived
of the title and become a commoner.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.460
What did you say?

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.740
There are rumors that

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.340
the disease of Young Master has been cured,

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.100
but the Third Princess
has been deprived of the title.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.780
It is true.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.660
People all say that

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.980
the heart disease
of Young Master Han has been cured.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.540
He can defeat ten persons at one time.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.300
How could that be?

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.700
Young Master Han will die
before his 20th birthday.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.740
If he does not die,

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.700
how could our master

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.500
marry the Third Princess?

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.700
She is not the Third Princess anymore.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.180
I don't know how Lin Qi

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.220
will treat the Third Princess.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.860
Spendthrift Chen Qianqian
was deprived of the title.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.260
She has fallen from grace.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.860
She stole the Dragon Bone
and damaged the fortune of the city.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.620
Only she could do such kind of things.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.220
If Huayuan City is governed
by such a kind of person,

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.380
our lives will be doomed.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.580
Now, she not only
has been deprived of the title,

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.980
but also has lost the ability of fighting.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.660
Doesn't that mean
she is just a worthless person?

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.380
The creditors will go to her house
and ask her to pay pack money.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:19.940
Do you think that

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.020
the Third Princess will still

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.420
come to the clan school?

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.420
Only princesses
and female relatives of officials

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.500
can go to the clan school.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.980
She is no longer a princess.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.220
Of course she can't come here.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.420
Do you think she did it on purpose?

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.780
Then the Third Princess doesn't need
to go to school anymore.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.700
She just want to evade school.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.020
We should stop calling her the Third Princess.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.020
Let's go.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:47.740
Your Highness.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.860
Why don't you worry about the Third Princess?

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.300
She dares to steal the Dragon Bone.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.460
There's no need for me to worry about her.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.780
My feet have been disabled
by poison for many years.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.300
She never said
that she would steal the Dragon Bone

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.460
to treat me.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.260
But the Dragon Bone
can't cure your disease.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.100
But what if it can cure me?

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.180
Your Highness.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:15.980
Forget it.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.060
Actually, I think that

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.260
she is better than before.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.780
In order to save another person's life,

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.220
she is willing to give up her title.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.540
Anyway, my mother loves her.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.540
Whether she is a princess or not

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.740
makes no difference to her.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.020
Zi Nian.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.940
Bring the shawl for me.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:50.740
Yes.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.700
Is this the book that Your Highness

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.300
is looking for?

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.860
Your Highness.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.700
If you need anything,

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:24.740
just ask me.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.700
Please don't ask Su Mu for help.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:31.820
Why can't I ask him for help?

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.300
He is not qualified to serve Your Highness.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.540
Why?

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.340
He is a musician.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.100
I don't know why

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.460
he is at the clan school?

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.140
I think

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.460
musicians are not different from

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.740
ordinary people.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.980
Please don't talk about
others behind their backs.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.180
Your Highness, you always only
mind your own business.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.660
Why did you speak for Su Mu today?

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.180
He is the only one

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.980
who has squatted down
to talk to me in all these years.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:11.900
It is my negligence.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.380
That's all right.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.740
I just think

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.100
he treats me differently.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.580
You can't enter Yueli Mansion
without permission.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.060
Chen Qianqian is just a commoner.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:29.860
She is nobody.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:30.860
I am afraid of nothing.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.780
Get out of the way.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.980
Pay back money. Pay the debt.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.940
You can't go in.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.500
Lin Qi.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:47.900
What are you doing here?

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.900
Of course for revenge
and protecting our rights.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.900
Now, everyone can speak.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.020
I have a complaint.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.700
The Third Princess lives in luxury.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.740
Yueli Mansion ordered
some glazed utensils from my shop.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.380
Five hundred pieces in total.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.380
They only paid a half tael
of silver for the deposit.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.780
It's been two years.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.060
The remaining 3,000 taels
of silver have not been paid.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.060
I have been reminding them to make payment.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.540
But they just said
that they would pay tomorrow.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.980
On the next day, they said the same thing.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.140
As days went by,

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.740
my shop fell into debt.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.580
Is that true?

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:30.780
Zi Rui. You...

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.260
I have a grocery store.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.220
Zi Rui placed orders to us.
He is the Third Princess's favorite servant.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.860
Under the name of Princess's Mansion,

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.420
he asked my shop

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.780
to produce a bamboo tube
at a price far lower than the market price.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.780
He also asked us to send 499 bamboo tubes

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.780
to the Third Princess free of charge.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.980
The Third Princess drove us too hard.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.260
It is your honor to

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.380
serve the Third Princess.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:54.980
But today,

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.540
shouldn't she pay the debts?

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.340
You...

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.900
The Third Princess should pay our debts.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.860
Pay our debts.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.660
We have brought account books.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.460
Chen Qianqian.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.420
Pay back money.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.300
Take them to settle the accounts.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.380
Pay back all the money we owed them.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.820
We must pay all debts
even if it means emptying Yueli Mansion.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:19.220
But...

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.900
Go.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.420
Move everything out.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.340
OK. Go.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.180
Move everything out.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:24.860
Go.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.500
What are you doing?

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:26.820
You can't enter the house.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.660
What are you doing?

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.620
You can't enter the house.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.260
You can't enter the house.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.940
No trespass.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.660
I want this.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.460
-You can't enter. -You can't enter.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.380
I want this.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.180
What are you doing?

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.100
Put things down.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.060
Don't take them away.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.420
Don't take them. Put things down.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.180
I want this.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.140
Miss Lin is very impressive today

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.980
just like I was before.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.140
Be careful, because every dog has his day.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.740
Your Highness.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.620
They are moving everything away.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.620
It doesn't matter.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.500
I don't need them.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.620
They are taking away antiques.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.700
No. I don't need them.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.220
They are taking away
jade articles and jewelry.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.700
It doesn't matter.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.100
Your Highness.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.260
Would you please stand up?

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.660
It looks that the chair
you are sitting on is nice.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.060
It is at least worth a few taels of silver.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.380
Zi Rui.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.140
Calm down.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.500
Go.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:49.860
Lin Qi.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.820
Money and articles

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.300
all have been taken away. Are you satisfied?

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.900
That is only a warm-up.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.820
The show is about to begin.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.460
Someone. Bring the victim.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.780
You see. You see.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.860
On the day when Your Highness
kidnapped the bridegroom,

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.820
you rode a horse on the street.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.860
My leg was broken by the horse.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.460
I am now a disabled man.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.580
It has been long since that thing happened.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.980
Why didn't you come here until today?

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.300
Proof. Please show me the proof.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.540
Everyone knows that

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.340
you don't observe laws.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.140
You galloped on the street carelessly.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.540
It is not strange
that someone was knocked down by you.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.700
Don't you think so?

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.060
You want to cheat me.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.860
The leg...

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.260
I know that

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.300
I lost position and would be
subjected to humiliation.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.340
I have nothing now

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.500
except my life.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.260
If you want
to do anything with me, just do it.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.860
Anyway, I am a worthless person.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.820
I cannot resist you.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.380
In that case,

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.380
please beat me.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.740
Han Shuo.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.060
I will deal with it.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.300
Even if they move everything
out of Yueli Mansion,

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.660
I will support you.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.260
That is real love.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.860
I am here. Who dares to touch her?

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.500
In the past, I was a little bit afraid of you

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.940
because of your position.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.380
But now, you are nothing but a civilian.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.780
You are only the Crown Prince of Xuanhu City.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.420
I want to see

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.140
how capable you can be.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.540
Who dares to touch her?

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.020
Pei Heng.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.620
Aren't they ministry footmen of the
late Minister of Defense Pei?

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.020
Yes. Minister Pei came too.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.980
Yes. Why did he bring soldiers here?

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.420
Whether Qianqian
is still the Third Princess or not,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.020
she is still my fiancée.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.660
We have been engaged for more than ten years.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.820
I will pay back

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.140
what she owed you.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.460
Whether she owed you money or people,

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.460
you can go to Pei's Mansion
and settle the accounts.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.380
Speaking about the leg,

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.220
you can take it from my body.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.860
She is now a commoner.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.180
She is not good enough for you.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.340
Besides,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.860
Han Shuo had drunk
Dragon Bone soup. He is robust.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.380
Even if you wait for another two decades,

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.500
you will get nothing.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.700
Whether Young Master Han
had drunk Dragon Bone soup or not,

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.300
the teacher and student relationship between

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.180
Qianqian and I will never change.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.580
Minister Pei.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.300
Qianqian's mother

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.540
is the City Owner.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.180
Qianqian's sister

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.780
is the future City Owner.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.780
Even though Qianqian is a commoner,

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.940
she is accompanied
by the young master of Xuanhu City.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.620
She is still engaged to me.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.500
Qianqian

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.660
is still the most honorable woman
in Huayuan City.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.460
I know that you always protect her.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.700
-Qianqian. -Qianqian.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.300
I didn't use much force.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.340
You are deceiving me.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.620
Thanks.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.940
Let me accompany you.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.940
Take a rest early.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.700
It feels good to be taken care of

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.780
in sickness.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.140
I will leave after you fall into sleep.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.700
I can't sleep.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.500
Do you remember when we were kids,

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.180
if you couldn't sleep,

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.020
you would ask me to play the Qin for you.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.020
If I didn't want to play,

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.740
you would punish me.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.540
Pei Heng. You are so good to me.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.300
Are you leaving?

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.500
It is getting late.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.740
After all, we are not married.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.260
OK. I shall let you go.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:34.980
I will come back tomorrow morning.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.660
The man of Huayuan City

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.580
can't be trusted.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.300
He said he would not play the Qin.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.140
Actually, he practices the Qin secretly
to seduce women.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.660
He is shameless.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.580
It is time to take medicine.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.820
Why are you drinking so fast?

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.780
Isn't it because you pour
too much medicine into my mouth?

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:54.940
I can't play the Qin.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.100
I can only feed you with medicine,

00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.580
so that you can get well soon.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.180
I don't need you to play Qin for me.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.540
I am very grateful to you

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.980
for taking care of me.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.340
In the past, I was alone when I got sick.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.060
I am here with you this time.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.700
Drink it.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.460
In the past, when I got sick,

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.220
I also had to write script.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.380
They would urge me to finish the script
if I hadn't finished it.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.180
The film production crew
was waiting for my script.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.500
What is film production?

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.380
I didn't dare to get sick.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.780
I didn't have time for dating.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.300
I couldn't write a good love drama.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.580
I was mocked by actors.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.180
Drink slowly.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:11.900
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.540
You are the daughter of Her Majesty.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.660
Who dares to force you?

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.860
You.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.940
Big tiger.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.420
I...

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.300
Her Highness has got sick.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.540
She needs a good rest.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:51.580
Tomorrow morning,

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.740
you should lock up the door.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:53.900
No one is allowed to enter the house,

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.260
especially Pei Heng.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.700
Understood.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.180
Chen Qianqian

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.860
is really a long-lasting curse.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.140
No one can beat her.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.060
The business nowadays is not good.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.460
We lost a lot of money.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.220
Lady. You had better think more about

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.740
family businesses.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.820
We only lost money on small businesses.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:23.900
I can live on the mines of Lin family

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.380
for several lifetimes.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.620
What do you worry about?

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.460
Though they are small businesses,

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.780
we can't let them lose more money.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.780
Apart from other businesses,

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:33.860
in our family,

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.380
the most profitable businesses include mines

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.380
and the Music and Dance Academy.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.700
But musicians
were taken away by the Third Princess.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.500
Speaking about the Music
and Dance Academy, I am very angry.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.540
Though the Second Princess
sent back all musicians.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.100
If not Chen Qianqian,

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:48.940
could the business
of the Music and Dance Academy

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.660
be so bad?

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.180
She even allowed Lu Peng
to play the lead role.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:54.980
Lady. Don't be mad.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.300
Chen Qianqian is having a hard time too.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.700
She is scolded by thousands of people

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.540
because of the case of Dragon Bone.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.300
She will get worse.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.100
She deserves it.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.260
Zi Rui. Look.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.020
These trees were planted by me.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.260
Yes. Only a few trees are left.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.700
You don't understand.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.100
There is a saying goes,

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.980
if I have Han Shuo,
I will have everything in the world.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.940
Though I have no money and power,

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.500
I live at ease.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.020
I don't have to struggle for a living.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:28.900
I am very happy.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.540
Young Master Han is from Xuanhu City
and he has no power and influence here.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:32.660
He even can't protect himself.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.260
How could he protect you?

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.300
You don't know how capable he is.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:37.740
Yes.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.900
Don't be deceived by his appearance.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:39.940
But you...

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.180
You are so weak.

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.820
Why are you standing in the wind?

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.580
Han Shuo. Eat fruit.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.740
Is it sweet?

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.740
Yes.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.900
Cooks in our family have all gone.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.500
I asked Bai Ji to buy some food
from a restaurant.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.540
Have a try

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.620
and see if you like it.

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.020
Why did you buy so much food?

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.700
It is too extravagant.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.180
You know my situation.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.740
I don't know
where my next meal is coming from.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.380
If...

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.580
Please don't worry.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:29.900
I have enough money

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.940
to support you.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.620
Your money?

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.660
Are you talking about your dowry?

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.180
You should call them betrothal presents.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.500
Something is wrong.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.700
The small coffer
you brought from Xuanhu City.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.420
If you say that they are dowry.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.100
I have nothing to say.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.060
But if you say
that they are betrothal presents,

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.380
shouldn't you give them to me?

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.220
You are right.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.900
Young Master. Think it twice.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.700
Do you want to manage my money?

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.060
No. No.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.580
Why do you think that way?

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.780
I just want to make it clear.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.420
Are they betrothal presents or dowry?

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:20.860
Bai Ji.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.340
Bring the account book.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.980
Why are you trying
to argue with Her Highness?

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.620
Let Her Highness
call them dowry if she likes.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.460
There is one thing.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.020
Since I have given you my account book,

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.220
shouldn't you call me husband instead?

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.780
What?

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.420
It doesn't matter.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.180
You are a lady of dignity.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.100
I will not force you.
