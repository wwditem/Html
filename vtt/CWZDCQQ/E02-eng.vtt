=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 2)

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.340
(Many talents compete in splendor)

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.840
It's nothing serious. She just got drunk.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.120
Drunk?

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.360
The Third Princess had never been intoxicated

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.110
no matter how much she drank.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.390
But one alcoholic drink
intoxicated her yesterday.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.630
It couldn't have happened.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.710
Your Highness, you are awake.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.760
Why is the dream still not over?

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.150
But... But...

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.280
Why is it still not over?

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.640
Did Han Shuo change the poisoned drink?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.920
Actors nowadays

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.680
don't even consult the screenwriter

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.150
before revising the screenplay?

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.640
How can I go back now?

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.870
No. No.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.000
Too much pain. Too much pain.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.750
No. No.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.870
Too ugly. Too ugly.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.550
Xiaoqian,

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.640
everyone dies eventually.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.750
Death is not scary.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.680
What's scary is

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.960
the filming will start soon
and you haven't submitted the screenplay.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.400
It's so scary.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.920
What if dying in the dream

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.510
means dying from overwork in the real world?

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600
I'd like to thank Han Shuo

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.510
and the actors who improvised.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.070
Thank them for giving a young screenwriter

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.480
the chance to learn about herself.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.790
But how can I go back?

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.200
Huayuan City's Second Princess Chen Chuchu

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.870
has gone through hardships

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.350
and finally becomes the City Owner.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.630
At Chen Chuchu's succession ceremony,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.480
auspicious signs occur, the sun and the moon
shine at the same time,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.680
heaven's door opens,

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.200
and the sky looks splendid.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.760
Gosh.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.790
If I have to finish this dream

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.040
in order to wake up,

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.760
which means I have to see auspicious signs
occur and heaven's door open,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.350
then I must endure to the end of this drama.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.240
Wait.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.350
If Han Shuo doesn't help Chuchu,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.430
she won't become the Crown Princess.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.790
Han Shuo.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.400
Zi Rui.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.070
Where is Han Shuo?

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.560
He is in prison,

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.910
waiting to be executed today.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400
-Why? -Why?

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.430
Stop counting. Just tell me.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.990
Her Majesty suspects that Young Master Han
has an ulterior motive for the marriage.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.840
So, she plans to use last night's incident
as the excuse to...

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.710
Spare him, mother!

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.870
...remove the bad seed.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.820
Your Highness.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.140
(Prison)

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.960
Young Master, our people are waiting outside,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.350
ready to rescue us.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.430
As for the plan to seize the Dragon Bone...

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.240
Tell them

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.960
to light the beacon tonight.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.200
The Xuanhu City Guards will march southward

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.600
and occupy Huayuan tomorrow.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.560
Young Master, you should think twice.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.480
The Dragon Bone...

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.630
Forget the Dragon Bone.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.680
Before I could obtain the Dragon Bone,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.510
Chen Qianqian could irritate me to death.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.790
I can't wait to capture

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.630
Huayuan City's Chen and her daughter.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.440
Chen Qianqian

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.680
will be put to death

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.030
after suffering from three thousand cuts.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.510
Not one less cut.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.280
Young Master, take it easy.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.310
As the saying goes,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.310
"A little plan spoils..."

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.910
"A little impatience spoils great plans."

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.240
We can't give up the Dragon Bone

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.680
because of the Third Princess.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.240
Your Majesty, the Third Princess is here
to pay you respect.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.750
Pay me respect?

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.070
More like she is here for Han Shuo.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.750
You are right.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.790
The Third Princess...

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.310
Mother! Mother!

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.960
Mother! Mo...

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.350
Mother, please release Han Shuo.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.630
Mother.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.750
Your Highness.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.910
Young Master Han attempted
to poison you on the wedding night.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.070
He should be executed according to the law.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.510
It wasn't Young Master Han's intention

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.680
to poison me.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.440
I wronged him.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.590
You had a high alcohol tolerance.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.310
You had never been drunk.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.790
How come one drink intoxicated you yesterday?

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.400
I...

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.790
When will Han Shuo be executed?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.910
Three quarters past 11 o'clock.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.960
What time is it now?

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.910
One quarter past 11 o'clock.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.680
One quarter past 11 o'clock already?

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.280
This is a life-and-death matter.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.120
It's one quarter past 11 o'clock

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.510
and you're asking me
about my alcohol tolerance.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.070
You...

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.160
Enough!

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.840
Of course that is important.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.510
You are my daughter, a noble lady.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.960
You passing out from alcohol

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.280
or losing a wisp of hair

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.400
is an important matter,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.590
not child's play.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.070
How fierce.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.910
Qianqian,

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.910
the black stone mine

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.030
has brought wealth to Huayuan City.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.400
All this time,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.510
Xuanhu City has regarded men as superior

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.030
and men as the people in charge.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.160
It's been at daggers down with Huayuan City,

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.680
coveting our black stone mine.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.000
Under these circumstances,

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.790
the obstinate owner of Xuanhu City

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.720
has proposed to marry his son off

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.190
into our family in Huayuan.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.070
What do you think?

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.880
Does he mean to surrender

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.000
or does he harbor an ulterior motive?

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.030
Never mind.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.630
I have told you this

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.510
for numerous times.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.310
If you'd been able to understand,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.120
you would have shared my worries.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.160
Han Shuo was supposed to marry Chuchu.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.160
I didn't know you would
snatch the groom in public.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.750
I... I...

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.240
I know I've made a mistake.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.590
I'm here to apologize.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.120
Besides, he and I

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.880
haven't worshiped heaven,
gone on a parade and had a wedding.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.680
You can consider us unmarried.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.560
Let him marry Chuchu.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.790
But the whole city knows
you snatched the groom.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.790
Chuchu can't marry Han Shuo now.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.400
There will be opportunities
to foster the love

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.720
between my hero and heroine later on.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.840
Han Shuo must not die.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.070
I understand.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.880
But he doesn't understand.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.720
He?

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.510
Do you understand?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.510
Your Majesty.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.310
Should we find a doctor for her?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.750
No need for a doctor.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.440
No doctor knows this kind
of thing better than me.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.310
Tell me. Whose baby is that?

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.560
I don't know.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.400
Consider it Han Shuo's baby.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.280
Nonsense!

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.000
Han Shuo entered the city
the day before yesterday

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.440
and married you yesterday.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.630
Today, you are...

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.160
You are pregnant.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.400
No.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.240
You useless wretch.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.310
At the end of the day,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.270
Huayuan City

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.760
doesn't restrain women like Xuanhu City,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.080
but we still have ethics and rules.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.680
As the daughter of Her Majesty,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.000
you should at least have some manners.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.030
Mother, it's two quarters past 11 o'clock.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.000
Sangqi.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.470
Go tell Han Shuo.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.950
If he is willing to acknowledge
his relation with the baby,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.150
I will pardon him.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.270
Yes.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.150
Go.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.440
You.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.270
Watch your mouth.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.910
Before enough months pass,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.590
you are not to reveal your pregnancy.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.470
(Yueli Mansion)
Here is Her Majesty's decree.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.680
According to the benevolent City Owner,

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.560
after Young Master of Xuanhu, Han Shuo

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.390
got married,

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.950
he has been diligent, obedient,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.320
and gentle,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.910
and he has been of service by making a baby.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.880
Therefore he is rewarded
with one jade scepter,

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.710
one peacock feather fan,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.440
three pi of green mandarin duck silk,

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.590
one box of green tea,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.680
one pair of glazed bottles...

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.910
Young Master.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.120
How come all these things are green?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.950
...and one gilded jadeite headdress.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:54.880
Young Master.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.000
Take it easy.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.470
Young Master.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.080
Young Master, you must be unaware

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.440
of a custom in Huayuan City.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.560
Getting a green headdress from your elder

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.590
means your elder commends you

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.560
for being virtuous, amiable and generous.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.390
Then

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.830
I should thank Her Highness

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.240
for giving me a green hat.
(It indicates he is a cuckold.)

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.200
Han Shuo, look on the bright side.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.150
The baby is not yours,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:47.950
but the woman is yours.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.680
Well, I also heard

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.470
of a custom in Xuanhu City.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.000
A man can marry many wives and concubines.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.680
A man's wife

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.910
should treat his concubine's child

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.240
as her own and take care of the child.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.150
It's the same in Huayuan

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.350
except a change of gender.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.760
Do you have

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.910
any problems?

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.000
Sangqi.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.470
You can't talk sense into him.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.590
Hey, the baby won't have your last name.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.640
Why are you so unhappy?

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:29.590
Outrageous!

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.150
I can't believe children in Huayuan
don't have their father's last name.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.270
Refreshing, isn't it?

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.560
Let me settle accounts with you.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.440
Take me and your Young Master for example.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.440
Whose house are you in?

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.830
The Third Princess's.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.440
Who covers your daily expenses?

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.590
The Third Princess.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.760
To whom do these servants belong?

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.560
The Third Princess.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.240
Who will give birth

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.790
to the baby?

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.470
Still the Third Princess.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.390
That settles it.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.790
Your Young Master can't
even help deliver the baby.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.150
Don't nitpick.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.270
I...

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.520
By the way, Your Highness,

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.390
Her Majesty ordered me

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:09.640
to bring you this.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.520
She said you loved eating this.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.320
What is it?

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:22.680
Your Highness.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.350
Young Master.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.150
What shall we do now?

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.520
Since she insists

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.830
that I poisoned her,

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.760
I should do as she wishes.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.680
Otherwise, my suffering would be for nothing.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.320
Tell our people

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.910
to take action as planned.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.350
I want neither the bastard

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.390
nor the woman.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.520
Yes.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.590
Young Master.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.790
Arrangements have been made.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.150
The glazed plate has been poisoned.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.950
She'll take the poison at noon
and the poison will act at midnight.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.350
No one will know.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:02.640
There are many more delicious foods today.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.950
Come on.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.030
Hurry.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.760
According to Huayuan City's rules,

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.880
when the Third Princess dines,

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.120
you must stay to serve her

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.240
and distribute the foods for her.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.120
Sure.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.030
Young Master, the glazed plate
has been poisoned.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.350
Yong Master, the glazed plate.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.760
Yum. Yum.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:37.760
Serve all the foods!

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.200
(Two hours ago)
Your Highness.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.560
(Two hours ago)

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.320
(Two hours ago)
Your Highness.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.760
The kitchen staff asked
what you would like to eat today.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.390
What would I like to eat today?

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.260
(Cold dishes)

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.240
I want everything on this menu.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.200
Everything on this menu?

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.710
And I want the best tableware.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:26.910
Yes.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.760
All the plates will be replaced
by glazed plates.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:30.150
What is a glazed plate?

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.320
A plate that has been glazed.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.520
Did Han Shuo poison the dishes?

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.120
Han Shuo, you disappoint me.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.880
I took pains to rescue you from prison.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.320
And you repay my kindness with enmity.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.910
Han Shuo, you have toiled for the whole day.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
You should sit down

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.120
and dine with me.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.680
No.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.270
According to Huayuan City's rules,

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.590
men must not dine at the table.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:14.270
You should...

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.440
Xuanhu City has a saying,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.440
"Follow whoever you marry."

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.080
Now that we are married,

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.390
you should follow me.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.200
Han Shuo, enjoy.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.830
You need to eat for two now.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.030
You should have all the foods.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.390
But the guest should suit
the convenience of the host.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.950
I'm asking you to eat. You must eat.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.710
Open your mouth.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.950
No. No.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.030
Living in harmony
and showing respect to each other.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.000
What a loving couple.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:42.920
Nonsense.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.520
Not in harmony.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.310
Don't stand there.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.430
Prepare another meal.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.310
No need.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.640
I'm done eating.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.800
I can't eat like this.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.070
Where are you going?

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.640
The City Owner's mansion.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.520
For what?

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.120
Food.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.000
I'm going with you.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.040
The glazed plate.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.760
Young Master.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.160
Bai Ji,

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.470
you know what would happen
to those who betrayed me.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.520
Young Master, spare me.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.830
I dare not betray you.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.640
I've always been faithful to you.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.280
I mean "loyal to you".

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.830
I've planned it all out.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.670
And I've poisoned a glazed plate.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.160
I didn't expect the Third Princess

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.800
to replace all the plates
with glazed plates on a whim.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.920
It was similar to the time

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.120
when she rode a horse

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.400
on the streets on a whim,

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.640
which sabotaged our plan.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.070
Things are changeable.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.830
I can't control them.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.670
Please give the people who have erred,

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.190
especially me,

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.800
a chance to make amends.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.120
It's not easy to eat to satiety.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.670
Stop eating if you are full.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.240
Medical books say,

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.160
"The eggplant is sweet, cold and smooth.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.160
It'll harm pregnant women."

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.120
You can't eat it.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.800
Yes.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.430
I'll have a crab then.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.240
The crab is cold.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.120
It can promote blood circulation
and remove blood stasis.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.400
You can't eat it.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.400
You are right.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.430
Spicy chicken.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.880
I can eat spicy chicken.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.640
Pregnant women can't eat spicy food.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.640
Who put it on the table?

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.280
Take it away. Hurry.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.670
My crab.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.070
Wait. My spicy chicken.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.640
Your Highness.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.280
You... You...

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.640
What's wrong with my hand?

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.040
Your... Your...

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.400
Your gecko cinnabar is still intact.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.310
Gecko cinnabar?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.310
No way.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.040
Chen Qianqian is lustful.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.950
How can her gecko cinnabar be intact?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.830
I have to get the logic
of the screenplay straight.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.590
Maybe Chen Qianqian is the type of girl
who smokes, drinks and whores,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.470
but has a kind heart?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.550
What a pleasant surprise.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.190
I'd like to know how you got pregnant.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.520
The gecko cinnabar is intact.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.240
So I'm not pregnant.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.040
Your Highness, you... you...

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.190
For a prisoner,

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.670
you lied about something
as important as reproduction.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.670
You have failed

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.120
to meet my expectations of you.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.470
You have off-key behaviors.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.430
You have disgraced us nobles.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.040
Outrageous.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.520
Truly outrageous.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.120
Where is Han Shuo? Han Shuo!

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.430
No, mother. Mother.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.590
Calm down.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.800
Don't blame Han Shuo, mother.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.310
Explain the situation, Your Highness.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.040
What exactly is going on?

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.710
I love Han Shuo.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.280
I fell in love with him at first sight.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.070
And my love for him is deep.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.880
I can't live without Han Shuo.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.190
I really love him.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.190
Please let us be together.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:26.710
Fine.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.880
If you were sensible,

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.550
you wouldn't be Chen Qianqian.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.260
But

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.590
you'd better get your man under control.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.240
As long as he doesn't make trouble,

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.710
I'll spare him.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.950
Otherwise, I'll punish you along with him.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.040
I'm full.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.240
I need to go back.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.400
I'll go back.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.000
Go.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.830
Take all these things away.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.550
Your Majesty.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.670
Don't be too sad.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.710
These things

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.920
will be of use sooner or later.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.710
I hope so.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.470
Yes.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.350
I'm in a difficult situation.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:19.950
People say it's dangerous
to keep a ruler company.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.640
I'm around a male ruler and a female ruler.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.950
I can live with the owner of Huayuan City.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.640
But what about Han Shuo?

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.670
He is like a time bomb.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.520
No.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.590
I must push him to Chen Chuchu.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.590
When the story ends,

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.400
I'll be able to go home.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760
But the plot is stuck right now.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:44.830
Zi Rui,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.280
what is a person who writes screenplays

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.670
called in this era?

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.470
What is a screenplay?

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.350
It's a story.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.800
A storyteller?

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.350
Yes. That's it.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.470
How do I call a storyteller?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.590
Storytelling, variety drama and lyrics

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.590
are all...

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.280
They are all written by storytellers?

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.470
Brilliant.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.520
When I think about it,

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.520
seeing what era this is,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.190
they are my predecessors.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.590
Your Highness, do you want to hear stories?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.670
No.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.830
I want to have a few aides.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.780
(Qingfeng Tea House)

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.280
Your Highness.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.310
Storytellers.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.710
The three of them are
the best in Huayuan City.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.430
I pay respect to you, Your Highness.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.550
Where do you work?

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.000
I tell stories in a tea house.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.350
I perform shadow plays under a bridge.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.000
I have my own theater.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.400
Good.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.880
They are divided into several classes.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.160
It's basically the same as our era.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.830
Take a seat.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.280
I invited you here

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.000
because I just

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.000
couldn't figure out something.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.190
I hope you'll enlighten me.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.280
Do tell us.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.430
I wrote a story.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.430
The hero...

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.800
The hero

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.760
is this banana.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:22.400
The heroine

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:24.590
is this apple.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.000
The female supporting role

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:28.520
is this orange.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.670
The original plot is like this.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.920
The orange snatches the banana
who is getting married.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.240
But on the wedding night,

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.550
the banana murders the orange with poison.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.310
Then the banana and the apple...

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.120
The two fruits...

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.070
No.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.400
The two people

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.520
go through

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.880
love and hatred.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.000
In the end, they become together.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.120
A regular work.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.350
Nothing interesting.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.830
It follows a pattern.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:51.920
That's right.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.550
But the story is different now.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:56.830
The orange

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.000
doesn't die on the wedding night.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:00.350
It survives.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.710
A plot twist.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.800
Break the mold.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.240
It can be a surprise.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.280
I'm good at comedy.

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.670
And it's a trick I often use.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.520
I don't want any plot twist.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.430
I don't want any surprise.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.590
I just want to create a regular work

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.830
and match up the apple and the banana.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.800
Then the orange is an obstacle.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.550
I suggest that you

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.070
untangle the situation,

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:23.040
and make the complicated plot

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:24.640
simple.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.880
That's so violent.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.400
This is a living being, after all.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.470
Don't do that.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.520
Your Highness,

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.190
we storytellers

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.000
have three techniques.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.350
The plot rhythm must be steady.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.350
The dramatic conflict must be on point.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.070
Be ruthless to redundant subplots.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.800
This orange is obviously redundant.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:50.950
It has to be removed.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.240
No need to remove it.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.070
I'm good at tragedy.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.710
Life and death

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.040
entangled with love and hatred

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.190
makes a story interesting.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.000
No.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.400
That's too simple and crude.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:02.240
You can find

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.190
a technical means

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:05.240
to make a detour.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.240
Am I right?

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.950
What's your idea?

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.070
Tell me.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.240
I'd like to put on a show

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.590
and make the banana

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.190
save the apple

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:25.120
or make the apple save the banana.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.280
What do you think?

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:28.670
How are you going

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.710
to put on this show?

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.710
Are you sure Chuchu will pass
by the Music and Dance Academy?

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.430
She definitely will.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.760
The Third Lady is here.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.550
She is a princess, not a lady.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.880
You have grown so tall.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.640
Looking at you makes my neck hurt.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:53.590
You are so thin.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:54.400
Please ingest more food.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:55.520
You look like a bamboo pole.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:56.950
Your Highness.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.800
Only your employer,

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.160
the brat Lin Qi,

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.120
fancies men of your kind.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.800
Lin Qi! Lin Qi!

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:07.190
Young Master.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.240
I'd like to see

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.040
what her plan is.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:12.880
Come on.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.800
Chen Qianqian, don't you dare go that far.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.880
As the richest family in Huayuan City,

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.070
my family has served Her Majesty
and made provisions from generation to generation.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.350
Even the Second Princess respects me.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.640
Don't assume you can make trouble here

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.920
just because you are
Her Majesty's daughter.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.830
What,

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.280
your men aren't talented enough
and you forbid me to criticize them?

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.310
My men aren't talented enough?

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.710
Have you

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.240
found a more talented man

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.310
to compete with me?

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.640
Sure.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.000
Everyone knows I have married

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.590
the Young Master of Xuanhu lately.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:47.040
What do you mean?

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.040
Let's have a competition.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.240
We'll see who the most talented man

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.920
in Huayuan City is.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.550
Fine.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.240
Who is your contestant?

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.190
Han Shuo is.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.760
Go find Su Mu.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.640
Yes.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.470
Gosh.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.000
The Third Princess is using
Young Master Han as a wager.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.700
She is betting on him.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.830
-Han Shuo. -Han Shuo.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.900
(The Music and Dance Academy)

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.040
So many people have deserted
the streets to see Su Mu here.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.040
The Young Master of Xuanhu
is going to lose the competition.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:53.310
In Huayuan City,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.070
women make decisions about their households.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.520
If you dare to defy me,

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.280
I'll divorce you

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.430
and drive you back to Xuanhu City.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.640
You'll never be able
to enter Huayuan City again.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.280
Han Shuo, you'd better think it over.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.880
Young Master.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.000
The Dragon Bone.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.040
A little impatience spoils great plans.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.310
Chen Qianqian,

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.070
you are pushing me.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.830
the Crown Princess of the owner of Xuanhu City

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:16.950
can't even defeat a musician?

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:17.670
You...

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.000
Our Young Master is mighty and masculine.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.070
He is unmatched in this world.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.160
That's great.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.590
Let's welcome Su Mu.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.670
Alright. Alright. No crowd.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.040
Calm down.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.760
No crowd.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.800
Look at me.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.240
Do you see that?

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.280
He's going to the Third Princess again.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.520
Only the Third Princess can draw him out.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.920
Your Highness, we haven't seen
each other in a long time.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.830
How come you are here

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.070
soon after getting married?

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.280
Is it because the men of Xuanhu

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.160
have no grasp of music theories?

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:39.950
Your Highness.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.190
When you are free,

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.240
come to the Music and Dance Academy
and enjoy music.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.190
Alright?

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:54.590
So good-looking.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.190
Why is Chuchu still not here?

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.520
I don't know.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.070
It's so pleasing to the ear.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.880
So euphonious.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.350
All the men of Huayuan City

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.830
can play musical instruments and sing songs.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:34.670
Yeah.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.400
What can the men of Xuanhu City do?

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.640
They can't do anything.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.430
Fight.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.670
Fight.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.500
So handsome.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.160
Young Master Han is pretty nice.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.880
Good-looking. So good-looking.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.590
What a shame.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.920
He has a heart disease

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:25.000
that attacks from time to time.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.280
I think the Third Princess

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.830
is making things difficult
for him on purpose.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.040
It looks like a goddess
is scattering flowers.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.190
Young Master Han is amazing.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.950
Where is Chuchu?

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.240
I've put on such a show

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.880
for her.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.190
Why is she still not here?

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.190
If she doesn't show up
to defend Han Shuo now,

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:52.350
I might irritate

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.550
this demon king to death.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.640
Watch out!

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.430
How dare you!

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.120
You aimed your sword at Qianqian.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.070
No, Chuchu. Chuchu.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.190
Chuchu, you got it wrong.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.590
I forced him to do this.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.240
Chuchu.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.670
You... You are supposed to help him.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.470
You are supposed to scold me

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:33.800
and reprimand me.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:36.070
You are supposed to be
the beauty who saves the hero.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.190
How can you two fight?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.590
Young Master! That's the Second Princess!

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.760
I've been told the Second Princess
is talented and charming.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.310
Now I finally see you.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.040
I'm honored.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:01.590
Han Shuo, please behave yourself.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.640
What are you guys doing?

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.120
Chuchu,

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:09.760
the Young Master of Xuanhu City

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.550
was forced by me to compete with a musician.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:12.550
I'm so mean, right?

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:13.470
Do you feel like scolding me?

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.590
Do you feel like whipping me?

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.000
It's one thing to take your
newly wedded husband

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.310
to the Music and Dance Academy,

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.400
and it's another thing to make
him compete with a musician.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:21.760
Scold me.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:23.920
Then take him to your mansion,
so he can recover there.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.190
So, you disrespected her

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.470
and attempted to assassinate her.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.000
It seems you men of Xuanhu
have no idea of virtues

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.190
and need education.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:37.240
Guards.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:37.760
Yes.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.000
Capture him.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:39.950
Yes.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.040
No. No.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.300
Chuchu, he is Han Shuo. You...

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.640
Just a hostage sent from Xuanhu City

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.400
to our city for marriage.

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:46.470
I see no reason to stand by.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.630
I've been giving you everything

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.710
you want since childhood.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.000
No matter how stubborn Han Shuo is,

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.390
I'll tame him for you.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.280
Thank you, I guess.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.240
Your Highness, you might
as well do it yourself.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.320
No. No. No.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:09.240
This is messed up.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.470
The plot isn't developing
in the right direction.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:11.470
My hero and heroine

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.000
are supposed to fall in love at first sight.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.760
But they are fighting now.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.910
Stop!

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.320
His clothing has been torn.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.470
Where are his manners as the Crown Princess?

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:40.280
It's out of control.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:41.910
Can somebody save me from this situation?

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:42.800
Stop.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.360
-Minister Pei. -Minister Pei.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:15.670
Minister Pei is so handsome.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.950
Forget him.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.000
The Third Princess has been
engaged to him since childhood.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.000
Hasn't she married Young Master Han?

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.560
Young Master Han has a heart disease.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.760
He can't live for long.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:25.360
Outrageous.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.320
He is the Crown Princess of a City Owner.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.710
How can we slight him like this?

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.080
Finally, someone said the right line.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.080
Pei Heng.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.800
This is my favorite role.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:39.080
How can we

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.470
tear Young Master Han's clothing in public?

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:47.430
Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:49.600
I bullied him and forgot...

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.190
Forgot about etiquette and rules.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.520
I was being unruly and willful.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.320
Let's call it a day.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.670
Go home, people.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:04.870
Go home.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.600
Look. The Third Princess really
listens to Minister Pei.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.280
Her new love and old love.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.630
And there is Su Mu.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.000
Let's go.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.710
Minister Pei, look at her.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.430
Right after marrying Young Master Han,

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:17.870
she took him to the Music
and Dance Academy for a competition.

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:19.040
How inappropriate.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.520
It's all her idea.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.110
Don't blame me.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.280
It's your idea?

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.150
Yes, my idea.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.760
Han Shuo, don't blame Chuchu.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.760
Chuchu, don't blame Han Shuo.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:44.870
Your Highness,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.320
come with me.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.950
I need to talk to you.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.760
Deploy the archers.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.360
If Chen Qianqian doesn't

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.150
die of arrow wounds tonight,

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.870
I will take your life.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.470
Yes.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.080
I didn't like you

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.800
because you were unruly and willful

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.040
and you acted recklessly.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.470
Since you ignored our engagement

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:30.320
and took the Young Master of Xuanhu
to your mansion by force,

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.320
you should treat him well.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.670
I can't believe you are so stupid

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.360
and have no regard
for other people's feelings.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.670
It's not like that.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.630
Young Master Han has married
into your family in Huayuan City.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.280
He is all alone and helpless.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.910
He has no family and friend.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.600
His parents are not with him.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.950
He doesn't even have anyone to talk to.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.910
He must be treading on thin ice
and every step he takes could lead to danger.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:54.870
You are

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.600
too willful.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:01.600
I'll ask Her Majesty

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:03.870
to cancel our engagement tomorrow.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.760
You and Young Master Han...

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.360
Why are you crying?

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.840
I'm also alone and helpless.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.080
I have no friend and family.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:19.670
My parents aren't with me.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:22.840
I don't even have anyone to talk to.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.240
I'm also treading on thin ice
and every step I take could lead to danger.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.470
I just want to go home.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.080
It's why I made this unwise decision.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.670
Pei Heng, stop scolding me.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.150
I like you very much.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.600
What... what did you say?

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.760
I mean

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.430
that I didn't intend to humiliate Han Shuo.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.600
You compared him with a musician
at the Music and Dance Academy.

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.040
You don't think that's humiliation?

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:50.950
I'm sorry.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.760
You're... sorry?

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.760
I know.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.760
I made a mistake.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.000
You... You are really apologizing?
