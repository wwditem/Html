=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 1)

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.180
(Huayuan City)

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.000
Women had a decisive say in Huayuan City

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.670
while men had it in Xuanhu City.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.470
The two cities had always been at odds.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.840
Xuanhu was defeated

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.840
after a fierce battle,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.760
so their Young Master Han Shuo had to marry

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.110
into Huayuan City and live there.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.520
I heard Xuanhu City's Young Master

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.110
will marry one of our princesses.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.030
I wonder which one will marry him.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.160
Men have the decisive say in Xuanhu City,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.030
but in Huayuan City,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.150
women are superior to men.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.350
Our officials are women.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.920
Our City Owner is a woman.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.920
All men are boors

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.670
and know nothing about high-quality life.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.670
Look at them.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.710
To get the black stone mine,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.440
they even agreed to send their
Young Master here as a hostage.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.510
Look.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.550
He's a handsome young man.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.190
Pitifully, he has a heart disease.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.830
All doctors said that

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.080
he couldn't live to 20.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.920
He's going to be 19.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.080
Why did Xuanhu City

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.440
send a dying guy here?

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.830
It bodes ill.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.080
Let's go.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.510
Move away.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.360
Get lost. You. All of you get lost.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.550
Get her. Move away.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.150
Get out of the way.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.790
the Dragon Bone was
Huayuan City's rare treasure.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.320
It could cure all diseases
and it was the only one of its kind.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.830
The main reason why Han Shuo agreed
to marry into Huayuan City

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.350
was to get the Dragon Bone.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.510
To reach his goal,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.990
he tried to get Chen Chuchu, the Second Princess
of Huayuan City, into trouble,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.200
so that he could save her

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.600
and she'd fall in love with him.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.840
After that, he'd use her
to get the Dragon Bone.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.240
Who are you?

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.680
Han Shuo, the Young Master of Xuanhu City.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.070
You're the one

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.240
who'll marry into Huayuan City?

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.600
You're good-looking.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.560
Clean him up

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.960
and send him to my mansion tonight.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.400
Your Highness,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.510
his marriage to you
needs approval from your mother.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.430
Taking him back like this...

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.910
...is against the rules.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.240
If your mother knows about it...

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.710
Since my childhood,
there has been nothing I can't get.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.990
The Third princess?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.760
He's just the Young Master of Xuanhu City.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.480
I'm going to ask for my mother's
permission to marry him.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.270
There is no time like the present.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.150
I'll marry him tomorrow.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.960
May I know who you are?

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.480
I'm the Third Princess of Huayuan City.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.070
Chen Qianqian.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.710
Third...

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.240
What to do?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.680
Young Master.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.840
Are you having a heart attack again?

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.150
Take the medicine.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.910
What's wrong?

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.320
Hold on.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.760
Take your time.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.720
I've had heart disease since my childhood.
I often suffer from heart attacks.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.680
Doctors said I'll die at 20.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.510
I'm afraid our Young Master
doesn't have the luck to stay with you.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.350
Please take back your words.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.310
It's something about the two cities.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.280
It'll be terrible if he dies.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.680
You're terminally ill?

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.120
In this case,

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.510
take him to my mansion

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.960
while he's still alive.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.680
Wait.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.720
As the saying goes,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.240
nothing forcibly done
is going to be agreeable.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.790
We need to give it a go at least.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.960
Cut the crap.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.720
Get prepared when you arrive
at the post house.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.070
I'll marry you tomorrow.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.590
Count yourself unlucky

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.440
to meet me.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.720
Your Highness.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.240
Your Highness.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.160
Obviously, she's taking him
for marriage by force.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.590
Oh no. He's going to marry the Third Princess.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.190
She's the greatest evildoer.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.790
She's spoiled by her mother.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.120
Look. The young man is in poor health.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.440
I wonder how long he can survive

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.720
if he stays with the Third Princess.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.240
I bet he'll die soon.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.120
Let's go.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.000
Alright. Go back.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.900
(Posthouse)

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.240
Young Master,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.030
it's beyond our expectations.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.190
Rumor has it that

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.840
Chen Qianqian is unreasonable and ridiculous.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.310
And she has no regard for laws.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.750
She is illiterate

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.160
and she suffers from Princess Syndrome.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.440
She even ordered everyone in the city

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.680
to treat her as a princess of the first rank.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.910
Princess of the first rank?

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.470
A city is too small for her, right?

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.960
But I remember clearly

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.720
I told them to frighten the horse of

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.590
the Second Princess Chen Chuchu.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.560
Why was it Chen Qianqian?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.880
What to do?

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.630
Young Master.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.000
Act according to circumstances.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.340
(Han Shuo calmly said:
Act according to circumstances.)

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.840
The hero saved the wrong person

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.120
and the hero was taken for marriage
by the female supporting role.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.910
I'm such a talented screenwriter

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.590
to create such an interesting story.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
("The Tiger Sniffing the Rose",
third draft of Episode 1)

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.260
(Available balance: 573 yuan)

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.820
(Available balance: 573 yuan)

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.160
When will they transfer money
for the script to me?

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.510
Mr. Zhang.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.310
Xiaoqian,

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.720
as for this script,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.680
it can't be finalized for now.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.960
I see. I'd like to know...

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.310
The hero

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.440
Mr. Han said

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.470
he has some questions about it.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.470
Can you go there and communicate with him?

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.630
As long as you convince him,

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.630
we can begin the shooting.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.960
Okay. I'd like to ask you about...

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.560
...the money for the script.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.720
Who will pay me?

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.070
Everyone, please step back.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.280
Don't push.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.680
Don't bother them while they're working.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.840
We're here!

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.470
Hi, Mr. Han.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.910
I'm the screenwriter
of "The Tiger Sniffing the Rose",

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.680
Chen Xiaoqian.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.590
-Hi. -Hi.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.910
I'll make a long story short.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.120
I've read the script.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.590
I think something is wrong with the hero

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.400
Han Shuo's character set.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.680
I see. What do you think... Mr. Han?

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.160
Can you tell me what you think is wrong?

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.400
Mr. Han.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.240
What do you think is wrong?

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.560
Mr. Han, what's wrong with the character set?

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.120
Can you tell me what are Han Shuo's
motives for doing that?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.310
As for his motives,

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.470
he wanted to get the Dragon Bone,

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.190
Huayuan City's most precious treasure.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.510
As the Young Master of Xuanhu City,

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.590
Han Shuo had heart disease
from his childhood.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.030
He often had heart attacks.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.440
Only the Dragon Bone could cure him.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.030
So, Han Shuo agreed
to marry into Huayuan City

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.680
in order to get the Dragon Bone.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.790
In the end, he was killed by Chen Chuchu.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.790
Okay. Lift up.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.320
It's just that a hero
often falls for a beauty.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.350
That's the problem.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.760
Why did Han Shuo

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.000
fall in love with Chen Chuchu suddenly?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.710
Just because she's the heroine?

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.030
Excuse me. Okay.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.390
Well. Mr. Han. Look.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.830
Okay. Lift up.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.520
Because the heroine is clever,

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.830
quick-witted, beautiful and kind-hearted.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.030
Isn't that enough?

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.790
Okay. Go refine his make-up.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.590
No.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.680
A healthy relationship is based on equality.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.150
People in Huayuan City
think men have to obey women.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.080
It's quite the opposite
for people in Xuanhu City.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.590
Such being the case,

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.120
I don't think Han Shuo would fall in love
with a woman from Huayuan.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.910
Besides,

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:49.910
Han Shuo is kind of

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.760
a male chauvinist.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.520
A male chauvinist?

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.790
Do you think we're equal?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.350
Okay. Down.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:07.710
If two people are not equal,

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.150
they couldn't even communicate,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.470
let alone fall in love.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.000
Just like you and me.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.590
Will you fall in love with me?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.120
As for the feminism expressed in your script,

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.880
in my opinion,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.880
it's not different

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.080
from the male chauvinism you criticized.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.120
The equality you look forward to

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.240
is not real equality.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.020
What you...

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.440
Madam, you've never entered
a relationship, right?

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.910
Get into a relationship if you have time.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.030
Then you'll be able to

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.200
write a better love story.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.240
Get started.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.470
Okay. Got it.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.950
Up.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.030
Okay. Lift up.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.470
Mr. Zhang, I tried my best to cooperate,

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.440
but it was impossible
to communicate with him.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.590
He flew away every time
I wanted to say something.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.270
I've even got a hoarse voice,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.470
but he wouldn't listen to me.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.200
Xiaoqian...

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.120
Hold on.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.880
I think he's insane.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.500
(Get-rich-quick)

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.660
(Available balance: 27.573 yuan)

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.520
Hello? Mr. Zhang.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.120
Xiaoqian.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.080
I thought about it carefully.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.080
Go ahead.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.710
I'm too young.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.790
I should've kept my bad mood
from affecting my work.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.200
Right.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.120
Trust me.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.640
As for the issues Mr. Han mentioned,

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.880
I'll correct them all.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.680
The shooting won't be postponed.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.520
Trust me.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.520
Tens of thousands.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.200
It's just about relationships.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.560
It's just about equality.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.790
Let me show you

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.030
what an excellent screenwriter can do.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.120
Han Shuo killed Chen Qianqian
and then deceived Chen Chuchu.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.390
After being treated with the Dragon Bone,
he began to rebel.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.470
He conquered Huayuan,

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.240
killed the City Owner
and slaughtered the common people.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.390
He turned hostile all of a sudden.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.590
Han Shuo,

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.470
I've never doubted you.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.030
Han Shuo,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.910
I've never doubted you,

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.950
but you're so cruel.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.950
You're so cruel as to treat me like that.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.240
Chuchu,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.080
when I become the City Owner,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.790
you can continue to be my wife.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.710
Asshole.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.150
No way.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.000
I can't write like this.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.440
Han Shuo really fell in love

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.760
with Chen Chuchu

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.320
after starting it as a lie.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.950
He conquered Huayuan,

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.950
but he let Chuchu go.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:08.880
After she escaped,

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.320
Chuchu endured hardships to plan retaliation.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.000
In the end, they had to
have a decisive battle.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.640
They loved and hated each other.
It's sad and weepy.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.120
I can't write like this.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.900
(Men in Xuanhu City can sleep with Kriegie
after winning, so can women in Huayuan City.)

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.680
I can't write a beautiful love story
because I've never got in a relationship?

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.760
What a joke!

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.390
I can't catch a cold.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.030
I haven't finished the script.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.320
Chen Chuchu, the Second Princess
of Huayuan City,

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.950
finally became the City Owner

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.200
after going through hardships and setbacks.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.200
At her enthronement ceremony,

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.950
the sun and the moon were up
in the sky at the same time.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.350
The gate to Heaven was wide open

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.790
and radiant splendor appeared.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.250
(The final episode)

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.710
I'm sleepy.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.120
It's hard to be a screenwriter.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.760
I had a good sleep
just because the script was done.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.380
(Supreme gourmet roast whole lamb)

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.780

(The famous painting of grass and bamboo)

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.880
Chen Xiaoqian.

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.080
What did you do?

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.150
You just got paid

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.910
and you dared to come to a nightclub for fun?

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.320
And you even did cos-play.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.910
Get up. Hurry.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.560
Her Highness woke up.
She's dashing wine glasses.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.680
Whatever. I've spent lots of money anyway.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.910
I don't care.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.710
It must be expensive.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.640
Your Highness, let us pay
our respects to you.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.120
Thank you for your patronage.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.000
What's your price?

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.910
For me, it's 1,000 taels of gold per song.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.030
900 for me.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.350
800 for me.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.880
But Your Highness,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.640
you can get all this for free.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.390
For free?

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.950
Well. What did you call me just now?

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.320
Your Highness?

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.830
Your... Highness?

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.080
Let me have a look.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.830
What a coincidence.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.390
A lotus bracelet with a small bell.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.760
This is a kind of special
accessory of musicians

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.350
in the Music and Dance Academy in my script.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.830
Could it be

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.080
here is...

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.830
Your Highness.

This dream looks familiar.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.550
I wrote it?

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.520
Oh no.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.550
I'm trapped in the script I wrote.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.240
My script tells

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.640
a story that happened in Huayuan City,

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.880
a place where women had the decisive say.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.310
In Huayuan City,

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.590
women enjoyed higher status

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.590
than men.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.240
If a couple had a baby girl,
they'd be wild with joy.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.950
Congratulations.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.550
It's a baby girl.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.040
A baby boy again.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.190
You good-for-nothing.

Do you want me to die without descendants?

were women.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.350
Men couldn't secure an official position.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.710
And they didn't have the right
to be educated.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.350
Want to study? In your dreams.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.920
You'd better think about
marrying into a rich family.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.280
Go. Get to work.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.350
Hurry.

Innocence is a virtue for men.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.000
There were five social classes: scholars,
farmers, artisans, merchants and men,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.120
ranked in descending order.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.830
I can't believe I became
the Third Princess of Huayuan City,

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.160
Chen Qianqian.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.950
The one who called herself
the princess of the first rank.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.980
(Debauchery)

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.020
(Luxury and Extravagance)

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.380
(Ignorant and Incompetent)

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.760
The one who took Han Shuo
for marriage by force

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.800
and was poisoned by him

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.310
on their wedding night.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.400
The cameo role who died in the third episode.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.430
Which episode is it?

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.000
Which episode?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.310
Well. I meant

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.350
what's the situation now.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.470
Situation?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.590
What does she mean?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.520
Your Highness.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:08.710
Your Highness.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.800
Your wedding dress is sent here.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.400
What?

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.190
Your Highness,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.950
you're getting married today.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.240
We worked against the clock

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.400
to complete the embroidered
wedding dress in time.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.950
Please try it on to see if it fits you.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.040
Episode three?

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.350
I'm telling you.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:45.670
Take it away now.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760
This is not a wedding dress,
but a mourning dress.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.640
Besides, I won't marry Han Shuo.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.400
He's a jinx.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.830
I have to stay away from him.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:51.640
Take it away.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.520
But it...

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.420
(Posthouse)

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.820
(Wedding Procession)

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:04.880
Young Master,

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.040
the wedding procession has been
staying at the gate since last night.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.190
They said they're here to protect us,

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.800
but actually, they're keeping eyes on us.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.000
I've been waiting here for a long time

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.880
under the order of your father.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.920
Young Master, she's one of us.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.520
What on earth has happened?

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.240
Why did something unforeseen happen

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.670
once you entered the city?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.830
I...

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.430
I was ordered by Young Master Han

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.280
to get close to
the Second Princess Chen Chuchu,

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.240
since she's the best candidate

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.280
for the City Owner

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.120
in the minds of the common people
and officials.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.280
Only through getting close to her
can we get the Dragon Bone

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.880
to cure Young Master Han.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.950
But unexpectedly,

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.710
it was Chen Qianqian's horse

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.760
that got frightened.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.470
Young Master Han saved the wrong person

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:07.670
and hit her fancy.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.590
It seems that someone doesn't want me

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.400
to have anything to do with Chen Chuchu.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.310
I guess someone let it happen on purpose.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.830
Young Master,

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.640
is it the City Owner of Huayuan?

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.350
Nothing is known yet.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.040
I showed weakness by pretending
to have heart attacks.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.400
I hope people here

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.120
can lower their guard.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.800
Young Master, please don't worry.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.550
As long as you give an order,

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.710
all secret spies hidden in Huayuan City

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.160
will keep you safe

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.470
and stop the Third Princess having her way.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.800
Here. Have a look. It's cheap.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.070
Young Master, are you okay?

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.190
It doesn't matter.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.520
I won't have a heart attack that easily.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.040
What shall we do next?

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.710
Push the boat along with the current.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.880
Now that the Third Princess
is eager to marry me,

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.550
let's do as she wishes.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.400
I'll poison Chen Qianqian tonight

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.760
to get rid of her.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.000
Then we'll go with the original plan,

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.350
help Chen Chuchu succeed her mother

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.120
and use her to get the Dragon Bone.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.040
When I get Huayuan's rare treasure

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.520
and my heart disease is cured,

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.950
I'll light up the fire beacons
on the lookout tower.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.040
Then our armies will be sent here

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.880
to conquer Huayuan City.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.310
Young Master, you're so wise.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.070
Kill all those
who failed their work this time.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.880
Young Master,

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.550
we're in the enemy camp.
We may get into trouble anytime.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.190
Please think it over

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.710
and give those who made mistakes,

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.470
especially me,

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.920
a chance to make amends.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.640
Then find out the chief culprit of

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.070
this accident.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.520
Kill him as a warning to others.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:22.760
Yes, Young Master!

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.520
Young Master,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.950
the chief culprit has been killed.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:36.880
You...

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.190
Who told you to kill the horse?

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.280
He had the horse killed?

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.520
It's a warning to me.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.160
I'll be the next one.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.040
Xuanhu?

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.000
A small city

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.920
at the border.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.550
They even sent their Young Master here

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.240
as a hostage.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.040
There is nothing to be afraid of.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.070
Han Shuo is seriously ill.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.550
Obviously, he's a worthless person.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.240
He could only vent his anger on a horse.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.400
In the end,

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.920
he'll be ordered about by you.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.550
At the border?

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.310
A small city?

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.550
Worthless?

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.040
Ordered about by me?

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.240
I'm telling you.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.000
If you want to survive,

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.040
never say those words
in the presence of Han Shuo.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.070
Of course I won't.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.520
In case

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.280
I really offend Han Shuo,

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.070
you'll keep me safe, right?

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.430
I can't even keep myself safe,

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.670
let alone you.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.760
If I do as the plot says,

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.120
drink the poisoned wine on our wedding night

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.160
and die,

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.590
will I wake up?

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:46.920
Your Highness,

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.800
let me tell you

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.240
about the procedures
of your wedding ceremony.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.280
Listen carefully.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.240
You don't like these unnecessary formalities,

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.310
but it's a different case this time.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.310
Since your mother got married,

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.160
no wedding ceremonies have been held

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.280
for over 30 years in Huayuan City.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.520
This time, you'll marry
the Young Master of Xuanhu.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.640
The ceremony will be grander.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.350
I don't want to mention
anything else for now.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:02.470
Just the flower parade

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.040
will include 64 horses...

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.470
You're Zi Rui, right?

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.000
To reach the necessary word count,

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.590
I gave you lots of lines.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.070
Will you always be a chatter-box?

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.190
I'm telling you.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.070
From now on,

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.710
you can say no more than
ten characters each time.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:21.400
But...

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.470
Tell me about the procedures.
In ten characters.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.400
Flower parade.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:40.070
With the Second Princess.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.470
Cancel the flower parade. I'm not going.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.430
What?

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.240
Your Highness,

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.640
it's unprecedented.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.640
I'm telling you.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.470
What matters the most

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.880
is to marry Han Shuo.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.830
Except for drinking "cross-cupped" wine,

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.430
everything else can be cancelled.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.760
Then how will we explain it

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.800
to your mother and your sister?

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.640
It's easy.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.800
Just tell them I'm burning with anxiety.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.760
I can't wait to celebrate
the wedding with Han Shuo.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.190
What?

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.070
The flower parade is cancelled?

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:05.400
Your Highness,

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.310
it's said that Han Shuo is eager to

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.800
celebrate the wedding
with the Third Princess.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.160
Everyone thinks

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.950
the Third Princess
was the one who can't wait.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:15.950
Zi Zhu,

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.000
Qianqian is my younger sister.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.190
Stop discussing her without respect.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.240
Please forgive me.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.920
It couldn't be better

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.070
if Han Shuo is the right guy for her.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.070
In this case,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.120
Qianqian will be more mature.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.160
Young...

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.000
Young Master.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.430
The poison is called "Soul Missing Powder."

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.190
It's colorless and odorless
after dissolving in water.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.040
Victims will die a sudden death
during their sleep,

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.550
before anyone else knows it.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.640
Trust me.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.550
No matter how they investigate it,

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.590
they couldn't think
it has anything to do with you.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.920
There is one more thing.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:13.550
I heard

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.590
Chen Qianqian's only strength is

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:16.880
that she's good at Kung Fu.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.430
Take this with you,

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:21.950
just in case.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.120
If anything happens,

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.670
you can prevent yourself being hurt.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.430
If something really happens
between her and me tonight,

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.520
who do you think will be hurt?

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.550
I've thought too much.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.190
Chen Qianqian is brutal and domineering,

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.760
but her mother is indulgent with her.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.400
Tonight,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.000
I have to kill her.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:05.920
Young Master, you're wise.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.760
Young Master,

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.520
the Third Princess just ordered

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.000
to cancel the flower parade.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.070
What?

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.400
As the Young Master of Xuanhu City,

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.430
Young Master Han deserves the grandest reception.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.350
How can she cancel it at will?

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.520
The Third Princess also asked us

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.710
to take Young Master Han to Yueli Mansion directly

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.000
so that they can celebrate
the wedding immediately.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.190
Young Master Han, this way please.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:45.280
Ridiculous.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.280
Outrageous.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.590
How can a bride be so impatient?

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.710
Bai Ji,

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.310
let's do as Her Highness said.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:57.710
Young Master.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.000
What's the next procedure?

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.550
Offering sacrifice to Heaven.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.550
Praying for permanent peace.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.280
Don't bother.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.760
I don't need to tell God I'm getting married.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.800
Cancel it.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.800
Take him here directly.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.640
The Third Princess and our Young Master

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.430
had been engaged to each other
in their childhood.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.590
How can she marry the Young Master of Xuanhu

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.040
and make our Young Master lose face?

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.550
What will he do

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:25.950
now that she's married?

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.350
Lower your voice.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.000
Don't let him hear it.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.880
You know,

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.120
he hates it the most

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.800
when we mention his engagement
to the Third Princess.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.800
It doesn't matter.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.880
I heard Young Master Han had heart disease

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.040
and couldn't live to 20.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.350
Our Young Master can afford to wait.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.710
He'll survive that guy.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.040
Minister Pei,

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:46.880
The Third Princess asked me to tell you

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.950
she'll keep everything simple
for her wedding.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.240
Sacrifice to Heaven

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.590
will be cancelled.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.120
So, the prayer for the ceremony will...

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.160
Okay. I see.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.400
Don't you want to know why?

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.800
The Third Princess is unlearned
and ignores rites.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.350
Now that she wants to cancel it, let it go.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.880
It can save me the trouble
of praising her in the article.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.240
I'll take my leave.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.520
What's the next procedure?

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.120
Go to see the City Owner,
that is, your mother.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.950
Cancel it.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.880
Your Majesty.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:46.760
What's up?

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.070
The Third Princess passed on a message.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.190
She said you have to attend
to numerous affairs every day,

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.520
so she wouldn't bother you
with a petty thing like getting married.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:52.590
She's running wild.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.590
I also thought it was improper.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:54.950
I've sent someone to her mansion.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.470
She's been arrogant
and willful since childhood.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.800
She's even more self-willed.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.400
Your Majesty.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.310
Perhaps the Third Princess

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.190
just thinks the formalities are unnecessary.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.800
Fine.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.590
Let her cancel it.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.880
It's no big deal.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.920
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.880
This Young Master Han

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.950
is in poor health,

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.520
and the Third Princess

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.190
is not that thoughtful.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.400
What if anything happens

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.240
and Han Shuo fails to tough it out?

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.520
Leave it to fate.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.040
Just consider as that Qianqian helps me out.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.420
(Accumulate achievements
to influence the descendants)

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.670
You'll get a divorce in the following cases:
you're not obedient to the in-laws;

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.550
you fail to have a female heir;

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.830
you have an affair;

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.310
you're jealous...

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:51.800
You contract infectious disease;

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.760
you're a big mouth and love to gossip;

00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:59.350
you're against rules and regulations.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.120
The seven conditions are the seven grounds

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:02.950
for lawfully divorcing a man in Huayuan City.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.670
I've remembered them.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.400
Young Master...

00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:14.880
This is also a custom in Huayuan City.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.400
The bridegroom will follow the one

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:17.950
who takes off his veil

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.350
on the wedding night.

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.550
It'll be considered unchaste
if he follows someone else.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.040
As for this,

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.520
I can comply with it too.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:28.470
Absurd.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.640
How dare you

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.400
ask men to follow these rules?

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.880
The status of women in Xuanhu City

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:35.830
is the status of men

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:38.280
in Huayuan City.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.160
You bi...

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.950
Bai Ji,

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.040
when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.590
What is it?

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:56.120
Gecko cinnabar.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:58.520
How dare you?

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.640
I decided to get married
to the Third Princess

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.310
to ease the relationship

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.040
between Xuanhu and Huayuan.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.950
As for men's virtues and the veil,

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.470
I've tried my best to be tolerant.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.470
But you're pressing at every stage.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.000
You're...

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.070
You're going too far in bullying them.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.120
Young Master.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.400
Why bother with the gecko cinnabar?

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:18.240
Even if you leave a red mark now,

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:19.920
it'll be gone after I sleep with him tonight.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:22.640
There is no point of doing that.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.190
You're right, Your Highness.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.710
I'm leaving.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.920
Young Master Han.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.670
Young Master.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.430
I'm not leaving.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.870
Young Master Han, shall we go through the motions

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:01.800
or

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.560
get right to the point?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.080
It's our wedding night.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.150
How could we not drink to add to the fun?

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.780
(Make Chen Qianqian drink the poisoned wine
on the wedding night.)

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.300
(... the poisoned wine)

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.080
"Cross-cupped" wine.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.800
I need to pay attention to my posture

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.560
to drink the poisoned wine.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.110
Qianqian,

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.390
we met each other yesterday

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.040
and we got married today.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.520
I hope we can support each other

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:41.040
and share joys and hardships together.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.390
Fine.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.710
In this case, I can go home soon.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.040
Cheers.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.320
What's the matter?

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.280
I'm sorry

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.950
for having your spirits dampened.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:12.280
Sorry.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.280
Let's do it again.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.430
Cheers.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.000
What's wrong this time?

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.360
Isn't it a posture

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:24.950
people in Xuanhu are used to?

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.870
You want to take the veil off, right?

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.280
So much trouble.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:41.910
Why is it tied so tight?

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.360
Why is it you?

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.950
Didn't you say you don't want to act as him?

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.390
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.560
Could it be that

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.360
you think I poisoned your wine?

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.630
As for this matter,

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.560
you know it best.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.280
Drop the act.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.040
Fine. It's not poisoned, right?

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.560
Okay. Pick one. Let's drink it up.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Let me tell you the truth.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.950
Even if I die today,

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.280
I'll take you with me.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.600
Servants!

00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:58.600
Here.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.600
I don't want to talk to you.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.280
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.710
Lift him up.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:05.280
He likes to stay in the air.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.910
Lift him up?

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:07.520
Your Highness,

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.360
today is your wedding day.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.760
Don't make trouble,

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.150
or your mother will be worried.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.240
Please think it over.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.840
She'll be worried
even if I don't make trouble.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.560
Besides, I didn't aim to do that,

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.800
but, he wanted to poison me.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.560
Your Highness, why are you saying that?

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:23.800
You don't believe?

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.110
You don't believe, right?

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:26.670
Fine. Let me prove it to you.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:29.150
The two poisoned glasses
of wine are evidence.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.630
I'm telling you.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.950
If I die today,

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.280
you couldn't survive.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.520
You poisoned the dishes, right?

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.760
Good idea.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.360
Great.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.110
Your Highness,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.240
what are you doing?

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.520
I'd like to see where else
you can hide the poison.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.800
Salty.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:42.150
Did he smear it on his lips?

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.760
It turns out you're a drama king.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:07.630
You!

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:10.190
Tell me

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.760
if I'm bound to die.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.150
Yes, definitely.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:14.600
Zi Rui,

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:15.110
if I die,

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.630
tear his body up by five horses and implicate
the nine generations of his family.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.520
Got it?

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.840
Young Master Han, why don't you explain to her?

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:19.520
Don't listen to him.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.320
I...

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.390
Zi Rui,

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.950
so many of you

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:26.910
are waggling here before my eyes.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.710
I feel the poison

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.080
has attacked my brain.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.760
I'm dying.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.240
I can't control my tongue.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.150
Oh no. My head is spinning.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.360
I need to sit down.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.390
Let me lie down for a while.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.600
Your poison has a strong delayed effect.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.710
Go get the doctor!

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:04.360
Young Master.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.520
