=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 18)

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.620
(Music and Dance Academy)

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.300
Yesterday Young Master Han and Su Mu
went to the tea house

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.340
and took a separate room.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.100
We didn't know

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.660
what they talked about

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.500
but we heard cups being broken

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.060
and people quarreling.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.620
I think Su Mu was killed by Young Master Han.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.140
But there's no enmity between Su Mu

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.620
and Young Master Han.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.300
It's for the Crown Princess.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.060
Young Master Han and Mr. Pei are

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.020
also on bad terms because of her.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.820
But didn't Su Mu

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.860
often go to the Princess Royal's mansion?

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.820
That proves it.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.340
It's because of the Crown Princess

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.700
that he didn't catch the embroidered ball.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.580
Do you think

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.500
it's because they both hated

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.380
Young Master Han

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.020
that Su Mu and Mr. Pei got along?

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.220
I asked you to tell me about the murderer.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.020
Don't talk any gossip.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.820
Your Excellency,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.780
the last person

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.620
Su Mu saw yesterday is Young Master Han.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.340
That's all that we know.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.340
That's to say,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.380
Young Master Han is the most suspicious.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.140
The Crown Princess was going
to meet Su Mu yesterday

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.260
and I did go in her stead.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.620
What's he doing here?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.020
Do you have any evidence, Criminal Minister?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.140
We found Su Mu's belt in the alley

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.780
around the Music and Dance Academy.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.580
There were footprints
like this on the ground.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.820
It's said that in Huayuan City,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.220
only Young Master Han has

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.700
such a pair of shoes.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.980
Here's the evidence.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.100
Yes, that's the evidence.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.260
I thought it was going to rain

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.220
so I wore the shoes you made for me.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.100
That's true.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.540
They're waterproof, non-slip and wear well.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.300
Do you mean

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.540
you admit

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.460
that you had an argument
with Su Mu last night?

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.980
When did I admit that?

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.300
Your Highness, you've always obeyed the law.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.580
I wonder how I should decide this matter.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.620
Why don't you just

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.380
be cooperative

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.900
and go with them?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.900
I'll take you home

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.540
when things are clear.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.540
Honey,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.100
she just said I always obeyed the law.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.380
It can't turn out to be false here, can it?

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.180
You didn't do it, anyway.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.140
Just cooperate with them.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.860
Okay,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.820
I'll do it for your sake.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.780
Let's go, Criminal Minister.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.140
Han Shuo.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.540
The Crown Princess ordered

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.060
that you should have enough to eat and drink.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.740
She also sent someone

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.620
to bring you your tea leaves and tea set.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.740
Your Excellency,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.540
we found new evidence.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.860
(Xuanhu)

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.980
For real?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.860
The guards

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.380
are your only trump in Huayuan City.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.020
Now you let me have this token.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.580
What if I don't deserve it?

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.380
I thought it was going to rain

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.740
so I wore the shoes you made for me.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.740
That's true.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.100
They're waterproof, non-slip and wear well.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.860
(The Prison)

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.980
Here is the Crown Princess's order.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.020
As the husband of the Crown Princess
of Huayuan City,

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.140
Han Shuo was supposed
to serve his wife properly

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.940
but he killed an innocent musician
out of jealousy.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.700
He should be beheaded for this heinous crime

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.940
but in view of his marriage
to the Crown Princess,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.420
he'll be banished
to the south frontier and guarded.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.220
He's not allowed to come back to Huayuan

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.100
or go back to Xuanhu.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.660
Han Shuo, take the order.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.740
Where's Qianqian?

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.980
I want to see her.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.380
(Divorce Letter)

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.180
This is a divorce letter she wrote to you.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.340
She's keeping something from me.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.900
Or you turned her against me.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.820
Xiaoqian won't do this to me.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.500
Qianqian said you'd refuse to accept it.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.580
Fine.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.340
I can let you see her.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.700
Young Master,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.340
the Crown Princess is waiting for you inside.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Why?

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.820
What reasons shall I give you?

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.740
I just got bored with you
and love you no more.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.780
Are you keeping something from me?

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.180
Tell me.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.500
We can solve it together.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.100
You promised me

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.580
no matter what happened,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.940
you would discuss it with me

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.940
and you wouldn't decide anything without me.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.180
Of course I'm keeping something from you.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.140
Didn't you also keep something from me,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.300
Young Master Han?

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.300
If I have done anything wrong,

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.260
I can change.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.540
You're so devoted to me.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.820
I didn't expect you to say that.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.460
Did you forget who you are?

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.980
Let me remind you.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.740
Remind me.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.620
About what?

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.260
Xuanhu City coveted
the black stone mine of Huayuan,

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.180
pretended to sue for peace

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.860
and sent you here for a marriage.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.180
Outwardly, you treated us like family

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.820
but actually you were scheming
to attack the city for the mine.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.980
Xuanhu City is good at
making explosives and weapons.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.700
We couldn't meet force with force

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.340
so I made use of your own trick

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.660
and offered to marry you.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.740
So the love at first sight

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.900
is a lie.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.860
In order to earn your trust,

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.740
I stole the Dragon Bone

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.780
and turned it into a bowl of soup.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.220
Curing my heart disease is also a lie.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:33.780
No.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.580
That's true.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.660
Because the Dragon Bone

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.900
wasn't that important to me.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.060
What did I keep an object for?

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.860
As long as you're in my hands,

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.940
Xuanhu City won't dare to step out of line.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.100
You're a living amulet.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.140
What about

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.340
the Soul Missing Powder you took by mistake?

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.300
Syrup.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.020
It was syrup.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.820
You thought I couldn't practice Kung Fu
after being poisoned

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.180
and felt guilty.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.980
It was all a lie.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.820
I just wanted your pity.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.740
From then on,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.980
you became so obedient.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.500
You were a tiger

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.660
but you were as well-behaved as a little cat.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.540
You put on the bracelet

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.300
and changed the explosives into fireworks.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.460
You even gave your token to me.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.780
Now you're all alone.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.620
Except the idiot, Bai Ji,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.180
no one can be of use to you.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.020
I know there are a lot of spies
from Xuanhu City here

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.620
and I won't stupidly banish you
to the south frontier

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.580
and allow them to save you.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.420
I chose a good place for you.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.100
Just go there.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.660
In this world,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.100
except me,

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.460
no one will know where you are.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.660
But don't think about escaping.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.980
I'll lock you in every day

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.540
and you'll be heavily guarded.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.220
If Xuanhu City schemes to save you,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.460
I'll give an order

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.140
and your City Owner will see your corpse.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.660
Only then

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.940
will Xuanhu City keep its nose clean.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.980
You're the only child
of your City Owner, after all.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.220
Did you do so many things

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.580
just to make me a hostage?

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.940
Did you ever have a little bit
true feelings for me,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.620
even just for a moment?

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:33.980
No.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.820
Why are you still taking it with you?

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.940
Just forgot to throw it away.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.500
By the way,

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.540
I forgot to tell you.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.340
Stamps don't need ink pads in some places.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.020
In that case,

Your Highness,

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.780
why did you join hands with Mr. Pei

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.340
and Mr. Su

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.340
to frame Young Master Han?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.940
Why did you divorce him?

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.900
Don't you think he's pitiful?

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.420
Why did you ask me
to bed the white jade bottle

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.580
in the wall?

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.500
Zi Rui.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.340
I'll take him back.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.180
No.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.020
Let me be alone for a while.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.780
(Huayuan)

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.420
Stop drinking.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.180
I... I knew it.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.060
I don't need Han Shuo.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.980
We can't give up the whole forest

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.340
for a single tree, can we?

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.700
Enjoy it while it lasts.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.220
You're just acting happy.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.740
Actually deep down,

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.460
you care very much about Young Master Han.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.420
You just didn't admit it.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.500
Otherwise, why did you
order Meng Guo to follow him

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.180
and send you his news?

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.940
You're wrong.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.940
Women should be mentally independent.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.340
Can't we live without men?

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:15.980
Can't we live?

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.980
We can.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.660
Dance.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.700
You... you stop playing.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:25.940
Get up and dance.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.700
Wake up, Che Pi.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.540
Your Highness,

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.620
you've played dice,

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.140
sung songs,

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.020
and danced.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.620
But why didn't you smile a bit?

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.100
I'm happy.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.060
We are not.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.700
You've been like this for days.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.300
Please change for another batch of men.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.620
Please let us go, Your Highness.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.500
Stop torturing us, please.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.500
We'd rather die than keep doing this.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.860
If you keep torturing us, I...

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.900
I really can't hold on any longer.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:30.460
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.060
Quick, quick. Go, go, go.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.380
Come on. Come on.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:35.860
I'm exhausted.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.860
I won't ever betray you,

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.100
or I'll die a violent death...

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.260
From now on,

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.300
you and I

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.660
are through.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.100
It's for Han Shuo

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.820
that I stayed in this dream.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.820
How shall I live my life now?

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.620
Don't touch them.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.260
Don't hurt your hands.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.700
He's gone.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.300
He's really gone.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.420
Give them to me.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.100
I'll repair it for you.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.260
Thanks.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.660
Are you still thinking about Han Shuo?

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.580
No.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.980
I just think this stamp is pretty

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.180
so I keep it.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.900
Qianqian,

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.300
you don't have to disguise anything

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.100
in front of me.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.220
Han Shuo has left

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.660
but I'm still here.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.820
If you can't overcome your sadness,

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.060
just consider me as him.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.300
I'll keep you company.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.060
Pei Heng,

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:18.780
thanks but no.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.180
Your Highness, I'm here.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.460
Now that you have no feelings for me,

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.780
there's no need for you to bid me farewell.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.580
Your Highness,

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.540
you must take care of yourself.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.980
Have your meals on the dot.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.420
Don't drink too much cold tea

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.180
or sit in a draught at night.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.380
Don't just read medical books.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.900
You can read

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.940
comic books and laugh

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.220

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.620
Su Mu,

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.820
I don't understand.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.220
Do you care about me or not?

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.100
People all think of me as a plaything.

I'm grateful for your admiration.

a constant topic of conversation.

good with evil, then?

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.500
Your Highness,

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.500
you can stand up and walk.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.620
Don't cry, Your Highness.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:42.980
He said

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.780
he doesn't like me.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.740
(A pure heart and spirit)

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.500
Mother,

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.500
I made a lot of mistakes recently

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.820
because I really didn't know what to do.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.700
I sent Han Shuo away

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.460
but I did it for his own good.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.220
Because I'm scared.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.700
I'm afraid his life will go on

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.540
according to the ending I wrote.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.180
I can't bear to watch him die.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.820
I want him to live

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.220
safe and sound

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.140
but not to be with me for a few days and die.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.140
As the City Owner,

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.860
you must have also done

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.420
things like this against your will.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.220
You understand me, don't you?

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.420
If you have had

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.380
to deal with it,

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.860
I guess you'd have been crueler than me.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.940
So what I did

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.740
wasn't too far, was it?

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.460
Qianqian.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.940
Qianqian.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.300
You woke up.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.980
I was half awake and you said

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.180
you sent Han Shuo away.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.060
What mischief did you get into again?

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.660
Help me up.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.020
Your Highness,

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.900
when Her Majesty was in a coma,

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.780
none of the doctors could cure her.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:04.580
It must be

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.980
because of your filial piety
that she woke up.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.460
That's nonsense.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.260
It's because she angered me.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.660
Mother, when you were asleep,

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.700
I successfully maintained order
in Huayuan City.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.500
But you sent Han Shuo away.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.700
I took great pains

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.060
to test his feelings for you.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.940
Never mind. I'll say no more about it.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.580
Let's talk about Yuanyuan first.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.020
It's time she got married.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.820
Lu Peng was murdered.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.100
What?

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.660
Yuanyuan is also sick.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.300
So for the next few days,

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.340
let's not mention the engagement

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.860
in front of her.

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.620
I'm to blame.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.620
That day Lu Peng came

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.820
to discuss their wedding with me.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.300
Unexpectedly, I passed out

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.220
and held up this matter.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.580
What... what did you say?

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.380
On the day when you quarreled with Chuchu,

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.500
Lu Peng was also there?

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:10.580
Does that mean

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.620
Lu Peng heard you quarreling with Chuchu?

00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.140
Chuchu...

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.820
what has the Second Princess
been doing in her mansion?

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.260
Your Highness,

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.420
she has been copying out
"the Classic of Filial Piety" every day.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.780
Every day?

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.860
Yes. She sent what she wrote here every day.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.660
I think something's wrong.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.180
(The Classic of Filial Piety)

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.580
Take it to the City Owner's mansion.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.900
Remember. Be careful when you speak.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.940
Don't let anyone know
the Second Princess has left the city.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:54.660
Yes.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.100
Young Master, look.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.460
The Crown Princess still cares about you.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.180
She prepared nice wine

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.580
and dishes for every meal of yours.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.740
The longer I live,

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.700
the better it is for her.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.140
Don't worry, Young Master.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.700
Her Highness has got it all sorted.

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.220
No one knows where we are.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.620
And don't try to escape.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.220
Live according to Her Highness's arrangements

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.020
and you'll still have a good life.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.060
Young Master,

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.100
I left a mark for Minister Yang
before we left.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.100
It's been a couple of days

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.540
and her men should have arrived.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.660
How come there's no news at all?

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.740
Chen Qianqian is cunning.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.700
Certainly she has done it after knowing

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.820
all my cards.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.660
Minister Yang

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.940
is not useful now.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.420
But before she actually locks me in,

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.180
she should check whether someone agrees.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:18.660
Who is it?

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.180
Your Highness, please drink some water.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.380
Chen Qianqian is not a complete fool.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.980
She didn't want us to find Han Shuo

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.140
and tried to trick us with an empty cart.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.660
The skills you learned in the army

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.380
came in handy at a critical juncture.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.540
I happen to be good at looking for people.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.140
There are just a few maps
in Chen Qianqian's study.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.060
According to those signs of wear,

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.300
it's easy to guess

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.900
where she wants to hide Han Shuo.

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.180
It must be hard for her.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.580
She expelled her love.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.540
Chen Qianqian is faithless by nature

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.260
and Han Shuo is unforgiving

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.540
and vengeful.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.260
Your Highness, if you seize this chance

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.740
to co-opt Han Shuo,

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.220
you'll be able

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.020
to oust Chen Qianqian through him.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.660
Just eat something.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.500
As the saying goes,

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.300
"It's hard to do anything
with an empty belly."

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.820
We'll rest here tonight

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.140
and leave early in the morning.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.020
If you don't eat anything,
I'm not eating either.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.180
I didn't expect you would take risks

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.180
to come to my rescue, Your Highness.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.980
You saved me on Weimeng Mountain.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.700
When you were in trouble,

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.340
of course I wouldn't sit by.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.580
Thanks for your kindness.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.220
Now you know

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.100
what Chen Qianqian is like, don't you?

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.540
It was a painful memory.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.020
I have an idea

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.860
and I wonder if you're interested in it.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.060
Go on, please.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.980
Chen Qianqian exiled you.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.260
Even I can't bear to watch this happening.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.020
How can you

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.220
resign yourself to it?

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.420
I kept thinking about it
and I want to help you.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.860
I have the token to deploy
the City Guards of Huayuan

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:41.580
and you have...

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.020
The City Guards token?

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.780
You're still being confined, aren't you?

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.980
It's hard for you to come after me already.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.380
How are you going to deploy the City Guards?

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.860
So you're not sincere in what you said.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.020
It's not that you want to help me

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.300
but you need me

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.780
to help you.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.180
True.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.700
I can't use the token for the moment

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.500
because of being confined.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.580
But I do have the ability to change

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.740
the situations of Huayuan City.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.140
The defense map?

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.180
You need me to help you

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.300
get back the City Guards of Huayuan.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.780
And I also need you to help me

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.540
get something.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.780
What do you want?

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.300
I want the black water mine

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.260
that was just found in Huayuan City.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.580
You only want the mine?

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.340
Or what?

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.100
Deal.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.980
Young Master, we're free already.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.940
Why didn't we go back to Xuanhu

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.900
but join hands with this woman?

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.900
Don't worry.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:13.780
I won't trust

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.460
any woman in Huayuan City ever again.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.980
Chen Qianqian,

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.380
one mine

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.580
is not enough for what you did to me.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:24.820
What I want

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.140
is the whole Huayuan City.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.700
Bai Ji, send a letter to Huayuan City.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.620
(Puzzle: Mother caught a stroke -
Chuchu called in Lu Peng -)

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.740
(Lu Peng got Yuanyuan's embroidered ball -
Su Mu suppressed Lu Peng -)

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.580
(Lin Qi whipped Lu Peng)

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.740
Why do I feel

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.580
Chuchu is more motivated
than Lin Qi to kill Lu Peng?

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.540
Where on earth am I wrong?

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.180
Mother has woken up now.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.300
If I find out

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.940
how Lin Qi and Lu Peng died,

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.940
will there be room for me
to change Han Shuo's destiny?

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.100
Your Highness.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.620
The letter just arrived.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.180
Meng Guo should have sent it three days ago.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.180
A suspicious caravan is going with them.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.660
They sell a variety of goods. Lingnan...

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.740
merchants...

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.660
Yes, sell.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.980
Sell... sell specialties of Lingbei.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.140
They're not at all sweet for me.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.780
I... I saw a man

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.860
who was small, thin but nippy.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.860
I couldn't help but think of Su

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.380
and miss...

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.820
What nonsense did Meng Guo write to me?

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.460
I sent him to follow

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.580
and watch Han Shuo.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.460
What did he write about Su Ziying for?

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.620
Who can tell me how Han Shuo is now?

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.620
(Huayuan City)

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.860
The Crown Princess ordered
that the city be sealed off.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.340
(Huayuan City)

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.180
Wait.

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.100
(Huayuan City)

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:23.900
Who are you?

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:24.860
This is Second Princess.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.580
Make way, all of you.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.540
Your Highness,

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.820
weren't you confined by the Crown Princess?

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.860
(Huayuan City)

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.260
