=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 19)

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.620
This is how guards are placed
in the City Owner's Mansion.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.300
I'll go in first and arrange things.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.260
An hour later,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.020
you go in with soldiers and help me out.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.140
Within a short time,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.100
I'll be able to deploy

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.700
the City Guards of Huayuan again.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.980
(Defense Map of Huayuan City)
With Your Highness' assistance,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.340
I'm in my element.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.700
Your Highness,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.820
the Crown Princess is here.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.820
What is she here for?

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.200
Young Master, let's go.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.900
Let her in.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.060
Yes.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.960
So

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.920
you serve Chen Chuchu.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.790
No wonder you repeatedly tried
to kill Chen Qianqian

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.250
on Weimeng Mountain.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.620
The Crown Princess is immoral.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.650
She doesn't deserve to be
the owner of Huayuan City.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.740
Do you know why I came?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.740
How am I supposed to know

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.140
what you came for?

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.500
Is it to have a heart-to-heart talk with me?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.700
Did you kill Lu Peng?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.700
Wasn't he killed by Lin Qi?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.020
You exiled her in person.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.340
Why are you accusing me now?

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.820
Did you kill him or not?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.940
Lu Peng witnessed your argument with Mother.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.060
Your reason to kill him is more plausible.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.500
Speaking of that,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.660
weren't you always against

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.340
Lu Peng marrying Yuanyuan?

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.580
You have a reason to kill him, too.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.460
It's indeed you.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.820
Now that you had reached a conclusion,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.320
why did you come and ask me?

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.770
Chen Chuchu,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.940
if you didn't want him to blab about it,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.940
you could just threaten him.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.400
Why must you kill him?

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.040
So now you know life is precious.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.670
When you wronged Young Master Han

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.590
and confined him for life,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.440
did it cross your mind
that life was precious?

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.680
Treating him like that

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.110
is even crueler than killing him.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.820
What did you mention Han Shuo for?

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.420
Certainly,

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.780
an insignificant Young Master

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.260
of Xuanhu City is just

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.220
a plaything to you.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.140
Without Han Shuo,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.580
you still have Minister Pei.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.980
I heard that

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.980
after Young Master Han left,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.100
music was played

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.820
and songs were sung

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.220
every night in your mansion.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.340
I finally know

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.500
why Mother would fall ill.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.140
If I had heart disease,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.380
I would suffer an attack right now!

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.180
Didn't you hear it all?

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.180
You are not important

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.540
at all to her.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.460
Watch the Second Princess closely.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.620
No one's allowed to enter
or leave Xingzi Mansion.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.740
Yes.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.200
The hero left.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.240
The heroine turned into a villain.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.220
The supporting roles are dead.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.420
No Wi-Fi.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.420
No phones.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.540
Only distress is left.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.580
I sent Han Shuo away

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.600
and stopped Xuanhu from conquering Huayuan.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.500
But my story also stopped here.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.780
No progress at all.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.540
Is Huayuan heading for its doom?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.940
The Crown Princess is always like that.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.700
She's simply hopeless.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.320
Stop drinking.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.220
If you really miss Han Shuo,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.620
you can absolve him

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.980
and order him to come back.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.460
Don't make yourself suffer.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.220
Han Shuo can never

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.140
return to Xuanhu or Huayuan.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.620
I messed it up.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.420
If Lin Qi hadn't died,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.080
there could be room for changing everything.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.260
Then he and I would

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.580
be able to be together forever

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.460
and didn't have to leave each other.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.220
I'll drink the rest of the wine

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.660
with you.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.340
(Many talents compete in splendor)

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.940
Han Shuo.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.460
I'm sorry.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.540
I said I didn't like you before.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.140
I was lying.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.060
I want to be with you forever so much.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.500
Me, too.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.340
Bai Ji.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:06.980
Young Master,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.380
you said you were going
to check defense of the city.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.820
Of course I came to see clearly

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.260
so that we can act tonight.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.220
Your Majesty.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.300
I hear

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.260
Qianqian went to
the Music and Dance Academy again.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.060
Looks like this child

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.980
is still stricken by love.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.500
Sangqi, to be honest,

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.580
Chuchu is fitter than Qianqian

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.780
to be the City Owner.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.500
Your Majesty,

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.540
these two princesses

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.820
are both pillars of the city.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.140
The Second Princess is brave and resourceful

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.300
and the Crown Princess is flexible.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.220
They both have their strong points.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.420
But after Han Shuo left,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.580
Qianqian

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.180
is no longer the person who loves her city.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.780
I'll reconsider my decision.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.860
Although Chuchu talked back to me,

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.260
after that matter,

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.940
she'll be steadier

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.540
and less impetuous.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.180
She's still cut out for it.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.620
I don't need her filial affection.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.900
She's not my own child, anyway.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.780
I only need her

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.660
to be kind to Huayuan people.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.300
So I think

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.780
I'll lift her confinement.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.940
Your Majesty!

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.860
Someone has besieged the city
and is attacking your mansion.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.900
What?

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.260
When I was in a coma,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.340
did Qianqian confiscate
Chuchu's flower token?

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.220
No.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.180
The Crown Princess considered their relation

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.780
and only confined her.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.740
What?

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.660
Your Majesty.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.300
Let's go back.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.660
Chen Chuchu.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.340
What nonsense did Meng Guo write again?

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.560
The weather was sunny.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.620
I was caught in a sandstorm again.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:43.900
Everywhere...

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.340
So much nonsense.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.660
The sandstorm was over. I lost track of them.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.460
How could he lose track of him?!

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.580
Oh, he's here.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.500
You... come and help me to my bed. Come.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.260
How long are you gonna sleep?

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.060
If I can,

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.780
I wanna sleep until the end of the play.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.180
I'll wait for you however long it takes.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.620
If I say I did it

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.580
for your own good,

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.660
will you believe me?

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.060
Go on, please.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.980
Forget it. Even I myself don't believe it.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.700
Come. Guard this place.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.460
What... what's going on?

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.940
What's happening outside?

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.260
Young Master, we've besieged
the City Owner's Mansion.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.860
You besieged the city?

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.940
I asked you not to make so much noise

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.060
and wake her up.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.300
I'm sorry.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.060
When I was on my way to exile,

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.140
I thought even if you were just a bit sad,

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.500
I would forgive you.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.380
But what I saw was...

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.580
No, I...

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.580
Do... do you know what acting happy is?

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.780
I have been really sad.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.180
I can even cry now.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.460
Then I'll think you were shedding

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.100
tears of happiness.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.780
No.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.020
It... it's just about comedy.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.260
Actually I think the plot is still

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.740
quite campy so far.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.980
During the thirteen days I was away,

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.660
I missed you every day.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.500
What did you miss me for?

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.460
Young Master.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.660
This is a gift for you.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.380
You didn't have to.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.180
You could just come without any gifts.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.220
What...

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.300
Your Highness,

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.260
drink one every day.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.820
What... what are these?

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.100
Should be honey water.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.460
Right.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.980
If you don't drink them,

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.260
your mother will have no medicine to take.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.900
She is in my hands now.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.180
Are they all honey water?

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.020
One contains Soul Missing Powder.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.420
Which one?

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.900
Guess.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.340
Try one now, Your Highness.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.940
No big deal. I'll just die here.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.460
Your mother's medicine.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.340
It's not honey water.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.580
It's bitter melon juice.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.020
Confine the Crown Princess.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:26.660
Yes.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.620
What did I do those things for?

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.300
I tried so hard to prevent

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.820
Xuanhu from taking over Huayuan

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.420
and it still happened.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.580
Order from the higher authorities.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.780
Close the gate. No one's allowed
to enter or leave the city.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.780
Let us out.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.360
Young Master Han is back.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.340
Soldiers from Xuanhu City are everywhere.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.140
If we stay here,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.500
we'll all have to die.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.700
Let us out. Let us out.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.820
What about the Princess Royal?

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.140
What about the Princess Royal?

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.260
What's going on in Risheng Mansion?

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:29.820
What's going on in Risheng Mansion?

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.140
Risheng Mansion has been besieged.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.660
It's dangerous there. Flee right now.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.500
Let us out.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.180
(An aura of orchid's elegance)

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.780
(Quietness and Elegance)
Don't touch that, you bastard.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.220
Will?

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.940
Your Highness has been lame for years

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.420
and has always been writing wills.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.740
How come you have never even

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.260
tried to kill yourself once?

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.700
Let's go.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.860
(Quietness and Elegance)

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.780
Your Highness.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.680
Your Highness.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:09.860
Your Highness.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.780
Su Mu.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.580
Your Highness, please get up.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.580
Zi Nian, take it.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.030
Your Highness,

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.380
were you hurt?

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.130
Now you're back.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.940
You really flatter yourself.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.500
I thought you said

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.620
you didn't like me.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.140
I've changed.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.780
I didn't like you before

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.700
but now I do.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.660
That's to say

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.180
you admit it?

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.700
You have feelings for me.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.620
Don't you mind that you're a musician now?

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.060
The city has been captured.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.320
It doesn't matter who I am now.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.440
But you may be in trouble, too.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:15.960
I, Su Mu,

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.620
was fortunate to be liked by Your Highness.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.980
From now on, I'll stay with you

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.580
until death do us apart.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.380
I would rather you didn't admit it.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.540
Now we're like

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.380
a couple on the run.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.820
Your Highness.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.900
These are all your wishes.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.620
Now most of them have

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.580
gone up in smoke.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.380
Luckily this one is still here.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:47.980
Your Highness,

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.540
look. To win someone's heart.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.580
Your Highness.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.220
Young Master Han Shuo
of Xuanhu viciously attacked

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.780
Huayuan City after Qianqian
humiliated and exiled him.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.340
Han Shuo rebelled but I'm still here.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.340
I've sent guards to protect your mansion.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.940
You'll be safe, Mother.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.480
You're indeed my good girl.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.340
I've taught you well.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.620
With you,

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.620
I'll rest easy.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.180
Where's Qianqian?

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.260
Is she in Han Shuo's hands

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.660
or Chuchu's?

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.300
She's with Young Master Han.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.340
The first thing he did after he came back

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.220
was surrounding the Crown Princess.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.420
Just surrounded her?

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.420
Yes, he just surrounded her.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.060
Good. That's a good thing.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.700
Yes. If Her Highness
is with Young Master Han,

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.420
she'll be safe and sound.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.740
(City Owner's Mansion)

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.820
Her Majesty doesn't feel well today

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.620
and there are city affairs to handle.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.220
The Second Princess, Chen Chuchu,
is promising,

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.740
brave and resourceful.
She can be of great use.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.300
Thus, the Second Princess,
Chen Chuchu, is specially

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.300
assigned to act in the City Owner's stead.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.780
If Her Majesty is not well,

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.540
it should be the Crown Princess who fills in.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.220
Your Highness,

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.700
isn't it against the rules for you to meddle

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.140
in affairs of Huayuan City?

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.160
Soldiers.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.810
The Second Princess Chen Chuchu

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.240
disregards rules set by the ancestors.

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.360
Does anyone else object?

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.780
Where's Sangqi? Ask him to send...

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.380
Anyone else?

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.140
Minister Liu, you always put

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.420
in a word for the Second Princess.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.820
Why didn't you step forward

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.420
and congratulate Her Highness now?

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:13.860
Leave.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.020
You can't go in. You can't go in.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.580
Go away.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.420
It's not too late for you to repent now.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.340
What made you say that, Minister Pei?

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.420
Answer me.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.060
Why did Han Shuo come back?

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.220
The disappearance of Su Mu

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.420
was fabricated by Chen Qianqian.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.060
Han Shuo is never guilty.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.500
Let me ask you again.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.500
Are the guards who besieged
the City Owner's Mansion

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.580
your men

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.900
or Han Shuo's?

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.460
Chuchu,

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.580
I know you won't take my words seriously.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.260
But I still need to say this.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.820
Everything you want

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.980
would belong to you.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.460
But if you grab it yourself,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.700
it'll no longer be yours.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.220
Now that it's mine,

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.420
it's just a matter of time

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.740
before I get them.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.260
Don't be bothered, Minister Pei.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.980
Oh, no. You're not
the Minister of Education now.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.220
I still call you Minister Pei

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.260
just for the late
Minister of Defense Pei's sake.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.820
The late Minister of Defense.
If my mother knows...

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.700
Young Master Han.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.100
You have had a tiring day.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.060
Let's discuss what to do tomorrow.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.140
Young Master Han

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.220
was uneasy when he saw Minister Pei.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.900
Does he still have feelings

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.460
for the Crown Princess?

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.020
Han Shuo is vengeful.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.060
If Pei Heng goes to save Chen Qianqian,

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.780
he won't be able to help her

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.260
but infuriate Han Shuo instead.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.380
(Yueli Mansion)

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.480
Don't go in, Mr. Pei.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.480
You don't have any real powers or forces.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:24.680
You're no match for Han Shuo

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.480
with our guards alone.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:27.420
If you barge in now,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.010
you'll be courting death.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.380
Even if you worry about the Crown Princess,

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.700
you still need to think twice.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.130
I have no idea how Han Shuo
will treat Qianqian.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.700
I must save her.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:37.140
Mr. Pei,

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.420
you can't save Her Highness alone.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.260
I must try even if I can't.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.700
Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:41.860
Mr. Pei.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:48.980
If you keep doing this,

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.100
you'll never win Qianqian's heart.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.140
But you can't even have her body.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.500
If you hurt her,

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.820
you'll be unworthy of her affection for you.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.540
Her affection?

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.380
What about mine?

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.220
You've been divorced.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.380
I'm taking Qianqian away.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.180
Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.700
Let go of me. Mr. Pei.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.300
Try it.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.540
Her divorce letter

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.180
only complies with rules of Huayuan City.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.740
Now we'll obey those of Xuanhu City.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.300
She's my wife.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.460
She's staying with me forever.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.220
Pei Heng.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:35.980
Are you okay?

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.340
Stop.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:41.980
Qianqian.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.100
Qianqian.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.780
What are you doing?

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.460
Han Shuo, let go of her.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.380
What are you doing, Han Shuo?

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.900
Put me down, Han Shuo.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:55.860
Let go.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.780
Let go of me, Han Shuo.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.300
Qianqian.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.940
Qianqian! Qianqian!

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:03.780
Go.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.460
Qianqian!

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.220
Please let Qianqian go, Young Master Han!

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.220
Han Shuo.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:30.980
Han Shuo.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.260
You and Pei Heng were really a pitiful sight.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.980
You begged me for each other.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.300
What are you doing?

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.860
Stay away from me.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.740
I once loved you,

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.500
respected you and cherished you.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.740
And you

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.220
were so unworthy.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.220
Don't you dare, Han Shuo.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.780
Of course I dare.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.980
And no one will stop us now.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.500
Listen, Han Shuo.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.260
Nothing forcibly done
is going to be agreeable.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.900
You won't know for sure

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.820
before you try.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.460
Help!

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.540
Help! Help!

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.660
Han Shuo, don't do it.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.020
Han Shuo, don't be like this. Han Shuo.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.700
Help! Help! Go away!

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:26.900
Han Shuo.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.220
Han Shuo, don't be like this. I'm scared.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.900
I'm really scared.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.060
What a spoilsport.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.140
Huayuan women

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.820
really disappoint people.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.980
She indeed can't do Kung Fu anymore.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.380
She just never speaks a true word.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.980
But what was I doing?

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.540
Han Shuo,

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.700
you beast.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.620
I was doing what a couple
will do with my wife.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:15.740
Did I break any rules?

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.260
And you are still here.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.060
Did you enjoy Chen Qianqian's yells?

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.940
You don't love her.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.340
You don't love her at all!

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.100
Love!

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.380
You love her. Does she care?

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.220
Chen Qianqian only loves herself.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.380
She doesn't love anyone else.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.100
I'll treat her the same way

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.260
she once treated me.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.700
Nobody gets away with doing that to me.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.060
You'd better give up as soon as possible.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.060
If I find that you try

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.340
to steal my wife again,

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.780
I won't be kind to you.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.060
Escort Minister Pei back to his mansion.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.540
What's that look of yours?

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.900
You're so good at saying hurtful words

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.460
but once you saw Her Highness,
your heart melted.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.700
You came out within such a short time.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.260
If you really can't do it,

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.860
shall I help you?

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.660
You help me?

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.540
Do what you failed to do

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.780
on Weimeng Mountain.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.260
Get lost.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.460
Come back.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.700
Replace everyone

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.860
with our soldiers
according to the defense map.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.540
Chen Chuchu is not reliable.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.780
Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.060
Mr. Pei.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.380
Han Shuo, do you think

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.380
I'll give up Qianqian like this?

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.940
Your Highness, are you okay?

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.300
Didn't you see it?

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.340
I shouldn't have cared about that beast.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.260
I should've let Han Shuo die.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.300
I just shouldn't have cared about him.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.180
Why don't you give in to Young Master Han?

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.540
What did you say?

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.620
When Young Master Han was exiled,

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.460
you thought about him all the time.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.660
Now he's back

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.700
and stands in front of you,

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.420
don't you also want to be with him?

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.380
And he'll stop besieging the city.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.500
Won't all be well, then?

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.180
Is the current Han Shuo

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.900
still the old one?

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.580
Now he's an-eye-for-an-eye Shuo.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.500
He's an an-eye-for-an-eye demon.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.420
An... An-eye-for-an-eye Shuo.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.460
But if you'd rather die than give in

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.180
and infuriate Han Shuo,

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.740
the Second Princess will be the City Owner

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.180
and no one will protect us.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.940
I think our... our lives are more important.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.140
Chuchu is going to be the City Owner?

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.220
Yesterday Zi Zhu announced an order
from the City Owner

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.660
and said Her majesty was sick

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.620
and let the Second Princess
act in her stead.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.820
I don't know if it's true

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:46.940
but everyone is saying

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.820
the Second Princess will succeed
the City Owner soon.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.140
Chuchu succeeds the City Owner.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.660
The sun and the moon shine at the same time.
The heavenly gate opens.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.720
It's getting back to the plot.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.140
What are you talking about, Your Highness?

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.420
That's the sign of a good ruler coming down.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.300
The Second Princess is not worthy.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:06.980
In that case,

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.300
I'll be able to wake up and go home.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.300
But Han Shuo dies shortly after Chuchu

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.860
succeeds the City Owner.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.300
Now Xuanhu has besieged

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.500
Huayuan City.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.580
What if Han Shuo actually dies

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.740
according to the plot?

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.220
No.

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.900
I can't let Chuchu be the City Owner.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.460
Quickly. Go in. Go in.

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:37.020
Look. Men from Xuanhu are ferocious.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.380
(Many talents compete in splendor)

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.140
Your Highness, choose one.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:54.860
Well,

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.180
well,

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.660
there were ten yesterday.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.380
How come there are only five today?

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.220
Isn't it more likely that I'll choose

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.340
the poisonous one?

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.380
Young Master said this was funnier.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.500
Funnier?

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.420
He thinks it's funnier.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.020
Has he considered

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.260
the feelings of the player?

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:16.780
Won't...

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.380
won't there be only two tomorrow?

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.380
It all depends on Young Master's mood.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:28.940
Han Shuo,

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.620
you are the obstacle on my way home.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.820
I can't let him torture me like this.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.860
I need to counter-attack.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.380
Exciting.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.540
Your Highness.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.500
Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.460
Oh dear. Oh dear.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.660
Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.620
Young Master. Young Master. Oh dear.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.340
What's she up to again?

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.940
Her Highness had a stomachache

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.300
after she drank it.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.420
Soy sauce, vinegar, honey water,
scallion juice and liquor.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.860
Which one can make her stomach ache?

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.900
But she drank all of them.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.460
You...

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.300
why didn't you stop her?

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.620
I tried to

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.180
but I failed.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.940
She did that

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.060
in order to see the Princess Royal, right?

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.380
I think...

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.180
It's aching.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.380
Help, Yuanyuan.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.540
It's killing me.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:05.780
So painful.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.020
So painful.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.380
It's killing me. It's killing me.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.180
Quick. It's killing me.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.180
Quick.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:16.900
Quickly.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.860
So painful.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.740
So... so painful.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.940
God, it aches so much.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.500
Just now I drank the same things as you.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.140
How come I'm alright

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.260
and your stomach aches so much?

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.380
That's because you're strong.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:07.860
I'm too weak.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.500
Quick, send for Yuanyuan. Quickly.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.180
Don't worry.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.220
To be on the safe side,

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.700
I have sent for a doctor.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:16.940
Doc...

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.540
Will be here soon.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.820
That's not okay.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:21.980
Yuanyuan is the best doctor

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.260
in the whole Huayuan City.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.940
Send for her. Quick.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.500
You're so seriously ill.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.420
Don't you also want to see your mother?

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.340
Shall I ask the City Owner to come as well?

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.020
If you do that,

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.340
it'll be the best.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.460
Chen Qianqian,

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.100
don't try to fool me.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.900
I won't let you see

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.940
any one of them.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.860
Now that you don't want to see the doctor,

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.620
keep aching, then.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.380
Han Shuo!

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.220
I'm like this
and you're still not helping me?

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.020
Aren't you well?

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.340
Stay here.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.220
Don't think about escaping.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:13.980
When you were away,

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.300
I missed you every day and every moment.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.180
Should you treat me like this?

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.380
Young Master, a group of musicians

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.940
came singing and playing.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.940
They said the Crown Princess invited

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.140
them over almost every day before

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.380
and now she doesn't do that anymore.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.660
They miss the Crown Princess.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.460
Almost every day.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.340
When you missed me,

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.860
you needed musicians to play music to you.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.500
No, Han Shuo.
There must be some misunderstanding.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.900
They... they slandered me.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.380
Ask... ask them to go back.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.340
Let them in.

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.220
Otherwise, Your Highness
will miss them so much

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.980
and get away to see them.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.980
You got it wrong.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.460
Han Shuo, you've really got it wrong. You...

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.140
Why on earth did you come here?

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.340
Han Shuo was in a fit of anger.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.060
Didn't you add fuel to the fire?

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.620
We came to play music to you.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.780
I'm so distressed now.
I don't wanna listen to it.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:56.860
Pei...

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.660
You need music more when you're distressed.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.180
Who told me

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.860
music could relieve my distress?

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.300
What are you doing here?

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.020
I came to get you out of here.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.260
Get...

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.780
How are you going to do that?

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.220
You're so furtive.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:00.860
Bai Ji.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.260
Look at me.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.500
Listen carefully.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.940
The Crown Princess wants to eat

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:07.780
roast duck and goose,

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.740
pig bladder with pine nuts,
aired meat and sausage,

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.620
crystal and amber pig elbows,

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.340
blanched and fried three kinds of meat.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.140
If you don't want me to name more things,

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.340
go and get them ready now.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.420
Say them again.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.820
Roast duck and goose,

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.980
pig bladder with pine nuts,
aired meat and sausage.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.580
Okay, okay.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.220
I'll go right now.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:24.380
I've got to be grateful that Bai Ji is

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.660
someone who can never do things well

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.980
and you can speak.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.740
Luckily Han Shuo is out.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.900
I speak so fluently.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.300
How's my mother now?

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.460
Her Majesty is under house arrest.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.660
Yuanyuan and Su Mu

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:39.820
are also locked in.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.220
They're alright for the moment.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.940
I'm really sorry.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.940
You had to disguise yourself as a musician.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.820
I once thought it was shameful
to please women

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.380
but now I think

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.020
it's also great to help the woman I love

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.900
and make her laugh.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:53.660
Pei Heng.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:57.700
I know.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.420
I shouldn't talk about that now.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.300
Did Han Shuo make things
difficult for you again?

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.020
No. He's quite nice to me.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.340
After what he has done,

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.900
you still defended him.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.780
It's a long story.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.420
I'm to blame.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.980
I forced him to be like that.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:14.440
Your Highness.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:15.680
