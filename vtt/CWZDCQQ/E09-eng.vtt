=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 9)

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.780
The Crown Princess Election will
be held seven days later.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.220
You're pressed for time.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.140
It's too late to practice
from the basic things now.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.780
I'll teach you a move

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.460
and you'll win with the single one of it.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.500
What is it?

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.940
Take a horse stance first.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.460
Lift your left foot.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.860
And then throw your right fist forward.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.020
This move can't work
without a good grounding.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.620
The Third Princess has lost her ability to fight.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.780
Why does Young Master teach her this move?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.900
I'll go and remind him.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.740
What are you doing?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.740
If you don't want

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.380
your Young Master to send
you back to Xuanhu City,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.820
stay here.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.820
Look.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.220
Again.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.220
Now lift your right foot.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.900
and throw your left fist forward.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.780
Go on.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.940
You did it on purpose.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.220
You want to make me look dumb, don't you?

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.740
You leaned towards me

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.300
again and again yourself.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.140
I'm done.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.700
Alright, I won't do it again.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.740
I'm serious now.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.700
I'll teach you how to defeat Lin Qi.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.100
How?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.340
Let me say it in your ear.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.180
I'll teach you a move

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.620
and you'll score one point
higher than Lin Qi.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.540
Even if you two tumble
off the ring at the same time

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.820
and draw,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.180
you'll still win

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.940
in the Kung Fu test.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.980
My goodness.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.140
That's amazing.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.460
How shall I do it?

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.740
Come closer.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.980
Okay.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.180
I'll teach you.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.140
Gentlemen,

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.820
today I ask you to come

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.540
because I want to discuss

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.380
the Crown Princess Election with you.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.740
I...

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.660
What's the matter?

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.860
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.820
Don't always kneel down.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.580
Quickly. Stand up.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.740
Stand up.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.340
Your Highness,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.740
there's a limit to our capabilities.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.620
We can give you advice,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.380
but as for major events
like the Crown Princess Election,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.180
even if we want you to win,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.220
we're powerless to help.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.540
Your Highness, forgive us, please.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.420
No.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.020
I don't want to win. I want to lose.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.260
Lose?

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.020
Stand up. Have a seat.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.100
Quickly.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.660
Your Highness,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.300
do you really want to lose
the Crown Princess Election?

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.780
Yes.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.100
For you,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.340
it's hard to win

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.540
but isn't it easy to lose?

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.780
I'm just afraid I'm too good.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.660
What if I win?

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.180
If I win in the Kung Fu test,

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.740
how can I make sure that I'll lose

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.060
in the literacy test
and discourse on politics?

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.580
When you compete in things

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.940
you're bad at and others are good at,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.380
you'll certainly lose.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.340
As long as you be yourself,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.460
you're sure to lose.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.740
I want to help Chen Qianqian
be the City Owner.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.700
Would you please

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.740
tell me your purposes?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.900
Chen Qianqian is simple-minded, ignorant,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.980
unreasonable, dissipated

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.300
and lawless.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.500
I live in Yueli Mansion.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.540
If Chen Qianqian is the Crown Princess,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.820
I'll be conveniently able

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.020
to take control of the lifeblood of Huayuan.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.900
Compared with the Second Princess, Chen Chuchu,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.300
Chen Qianqian is easier to control

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.380
as the Crown Princess of Huayuan City.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.380
Anyway,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.620
the Crown Princess must be Chen Qianqian.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.380
Now that she doesn't want to try hard,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.900
let's give her a hand.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.780
Yes.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.860
The test starts now.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.540
(The First Test:
Literacy Test)

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.220
Can I hand in my paper in advance?

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.860
No.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.780
(Qian)

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.580
(Qian)

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.260
(Qian)

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.340
Is there anything else I need to do?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.620
No. Off you go.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.540
Yes.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.260
Your Highness,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.180
was it hard? How did you do in it?

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.780
It was so easy.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.220
I drew beautifully.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.660
You drew beautifully?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.860
(The Second Test:
The Kung Fu test)

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.900
The Kung Fu test of the Crown Princess Election.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.340
There are fifteen contestants in total.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.900
The winner of a game gets one point.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.460
The two people who score
the highest reach the final.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.900
The winner will be the best
in the Kung Fu test.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.460
Chen Qianqian, Li Yilan,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.940
come here, please.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.580
Don't be afraid, Your Highness.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.980
You're a brave and skillful fighter
who never lose.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.660
You are winning already.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.100
Can we just shake hands? I admit defeat.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.740
Swords are merciless
and lives are unpredictable.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.020
Everything on the ring is predestined.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.500
Sign the disclaimer, please.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.060
Sign the disclaimer?

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.380
Do you have to be so serious?

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.260
(Disclaimer
Chen Qianqian; Li Yilan)

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.420
The one who chickens out, lost.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.420
The one who causes disorder, lost.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.300
The one who falls off the ring, lost.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.100
The one who hits the truce gong, lost.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.580
The competition will start now.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.060
I've arranged with her.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.700
She's on our side.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.580
Lin Qi has also bought some people off.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.740
The Third Princess is a shoo-in.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.060
Dodge, Your Highness.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.540
I want to but I can't move my legs.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.460
Bravo. Bravo.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.700
Fantastic.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.260
Chen Qianqian, one point.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.180
(One)

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.100
Your Highness, you're so agile.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.980
I... I didn't expect it.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.380
Your Majesty, I hear

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.900
Miss Lin Qi

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.620
has bribed the Third Princess's opponents.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.900
I could never expect

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.940
Lin Qi to be so reliable.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.580
Lin Qi has always been

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.380
a competitive child.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.700
She'll seize every chance

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.420
to embarrass Qianqian.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.660
I worry

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.380
if the Third Princess makes it to the final

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.420
and has to fight Lin Qi,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.540
then...

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.420
Don't be afraid.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.060
Han Shuo will help her.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.980
He's not a man to be trifled with

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.620
and he adores Qianqian.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.460
He won't watch her being hurt.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.380
(Two)
Qianqian may get something for nothing.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.860
The Third Princess has been given

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.380
a lot of support recently.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.220
If she performs well in this election,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.740
will she be the Crown Princess?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.860
Let's just wait and see.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.020
Dedicated actresses like this

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.340
should be paid at least
300 yuan a day in Hengdian.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.580
Young Master, I've never seen that person.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.100
It seems we haven't bought her off.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.820
Is she on Lin Qi's side?

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.060
No, she's not.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.660
Is she a dark horse?

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.660
Zi Rui, tell Her Highness

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.740
to default on this game.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.180
Your Highness, come down here.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.260
Don't play this game.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.300
Don't distract me.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.100
Just watch how I defeat her.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.540
Sorry about that, Your Highness.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.940
Are we fighting actually now?

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.500
As long as I run fast enough,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.500
you won't be able to catch me.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.060
Quick. Quick. Quick.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.460
When can I... when...

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.340
The one who fights negatively will also lose.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:09.980
Okay. Okay.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.300
Okay. Okay.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.860
Why do you have so much strength?

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.580
Your vital capacity is over 800, isn't it?

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.860
It must be.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.180
Just go.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.940
Bravo. Bravo.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.860
Chen Qianqian has won

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.500
and reached the final.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.820
You can't sleep either?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.260
You'll compete with Lin Qi tomorrow.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.740
It's sure to be tough.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.620
I just wish it wouldn't be too painful.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.900
Pain is unavoidable.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.340
Will I die?

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.380
You're the Third Princess.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.020
Lin Qi won't dare to go too far

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.180
even if she wants to make you suffer.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.260
As long as you bear
what I've taught you in mind,

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.700
it's still possible that you'll win.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.260
But

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.220
you fear pain so much.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.460
You can withdraw from the final.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.380
Tell me when you can't hold on anymore.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.860
I'll hit the truce gong for you.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.180
How can we do that?

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.100
I've said those things.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.700
If I give up now,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.860
Yuanyuan will be more
reluctant to listen to me.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:46.940
Her disability is

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.780
more or less related to me.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.860
I can't give up.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.180
She can't give up either.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.660
There's a custom in Xuanhu City.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.940
If you tell the full moon your wish,

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.980
it'll come true.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.860
So many people tell the moon their wishes.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:15.980
Can it hear mine?

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.580
Let's be closer to the moon

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.740

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.140

I hear yesterday the Third Princess

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.780
beat one opponent after another

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.660
with great courage

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.140
and earned her qualification for the final.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
She's competing with Miss Lin Qi today.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.180
Even though

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.620
she has lost her ability to fight,

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.780
she can still win in the Kung Fu test.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.260
Don't you want to go and watch her battle?

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.260
She must have done some wicked things.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.820
Many people will be there, too.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.060

I'm weak. I can't bear that.

I don't want to go out.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.100
But Your Highness,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.740
you've got cleaned up and dressed.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.260
You've even taken your cloak out.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.060
Aren't you going to watch it?

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.140
Nonsense.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.660

What brings you here?

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.180
The Third Princess is afraid
you won't watch her fight

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.620
and she really wants you to be there.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.940
So she's specially asked me to persuade you.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.700
Zi Nian,

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.020
push me to the study.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.380

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.140
and Lin Qi has never won.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.020
Now

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.980
the Third Princess loses all her Kung Fu.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.020
Lin Qi will definitely take her revenge now.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.100
Everyone in Huayuan City
knows how her whip kills.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.180
The Third Princess is losing.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.340

Let's change for another way of fighting.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.740
Okay.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.020

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.380
What's that?

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.820
It means slow motion.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.580

and get into a hand-to-hand fight with her.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.140
You just need to hit her down the ring.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.740
Chen Qianqian,

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.620
this is a competition!

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.620
Are you shameless?

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.380
Everyone is shameless
at such a critical moment.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.860
Stop!

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.500
This is undignified.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:20.900
Let go, both of you.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.100
Lin Qi, I'll say one, two, three.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.500
Let's let go together.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:26.780
Okay.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.140
One, two, three.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.980
You're a liar.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.540
So are you.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.940
What are you doing?

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.380
Lin Qi, what are you doing?

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.100
Chen Qianqian,

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.820
it's useless playing tricks on me.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.380
If you don't want to suffer pain,

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.900
admit defeat now.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.980
Admit that you're a loser.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.220
Twelve.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.580
Why is Yuanyuan still not here?

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.740
Do you know it now?

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.540
There's no possibility that you'll win.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.020
What's the Third Princess doing?

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.540
Why did she take her protector off?

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.540
Only then will she be likely to win.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.940
Twenty-one.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.740
Listen,

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.420
I was testing you just now.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.100
The real combat

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.300
starts now.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:11.860
See?

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.140
The Third Princess is unconquerable.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.380
Lin Qi is really daring.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.020
That's the Third Princess.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.820
Because she's rolling in it.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.420
Good, that's my girl.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.420
The Third Princess

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.540
resembles you so much.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.660
This is great.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.140
If Qianqian earns

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.740
her spurs in this election,

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.700
I'll have one more option

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.660
and I won't have to let someone

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.100
have control of her life.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.060
Qianqian. Stop. Qianqian!

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.060
What are you doing?

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.060
It's such a dangerous thing.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.500
Aren't you afraid Lin Qi will hurt her?

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.300
Let go of me!

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.380
It's her wish.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.340
I just give her what she wants.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.100
She doesn't know any Kung Fu now.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.340
What's the point of taking this test?

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.020
To you she's worthless.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.300
But to my mind...

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.420
Chen Qianqian.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.780
She's not.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:14.900
Get up.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.860
Zi Rui, hit the truce gong.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.940
No.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.700
Have faith in her.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.940
How do you know she won't win?

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.220
In my opinion,

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.580
as long as she wants to,

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.140
she can do anything in the world.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.260
Can you bear this?

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.340
I can't.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.260
But so what?

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.420
She'll be unhappier if I hit the gong.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.980
If you admit defeat now,

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.140
I'll let you live.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.020
You're so noisy.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.820
What matters most is that she lives.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.260
Minister Pei.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.820
I'm the only child of
the deceased Minister of Defense

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.940
and the Minister of Education.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:07.900
Don't you dare to stop me.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.780
Calm down, Minister Pei.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.780
According to rules of the contest,

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.860
only the competitors' husbands or parents...

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.620
The Third Princess and I have been
engaged for fifteen years.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.980
Except Her Majesty,

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.420
no one's more eligible than me.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.140
Go away.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.420
Qianqian, admit defeat.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.980
The truce gong has been hit.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.500
Chen Qianqian has admitted defeat.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.220
She hasn't.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.340
When have I admitted defeat?

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.060
Your Highness,

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.460
Minister Pei has hit the truce gong for you.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.420
The Third Princess has admitted defeat.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.460
Lin Qi has won.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:41.940
Pei Heng.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.820
Qianqian, give up.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.060
I don't accept

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.140
this hit of the truce gong.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.140
Pei Heng is not my parent, brother

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.940
or even my husband.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.860
His hit of the truce gong

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.660
means nothing.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.620
I don't accept it either.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.260
Chen Qianqian has married Han Shuo.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.140
She's not engaged to Minister Pei any more.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.140
Qianqian,

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.620
you and Han Shuo didn't
offer sacrifices, parade down streets

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.580
or even hold a wedding.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.140
You're not a couple.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.580
He hasn't even lived at your house
more than three months.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.940
You and I grew up together

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.420
and we've been engaged for fifteen years.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.340
I'm more eligible than him to hit the gong.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.100
Take my advice. Come down.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.700
Your Highness,

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.340
you can only choose either Minister Pei

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.140
or Young Master Han to act on your behalf.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.140
Pei Heng,

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.140
I know you did it for my own good

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.340
but I must keep fighting.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.620
I choose Han Shuo.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.420
Han Shuo hasn't hit the truce gong.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.020
I haven't admitted defeat.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.460
Continue.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.260
The hitting of the truce gong is invalid.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.140
The competitors will go on with the game.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.420
Heavens,

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.180
the most good-looking man in Huayuan City,

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.380
Minister Pei, was turned down in public.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.100
It's really embarrassing.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.020
After this,

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.740
can he still marry a good lady?

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.020
But what's up with the Third Princess?

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.020
She always fooled around before.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.980
Why's she trying so hard today?

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.220
Women are so charming when being like that.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:40.780
You think you stopped her from being hurt

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.980
for her own good.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.660
You don't know her at all.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.300
It seems

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.420
Minister Pei

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.100
doesn't know the Third Princess
as well as Young Master Han.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.380
Han Shuo watched Qianqian

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.140
being humiliated so much

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.780
but he didn't move a bit

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.580
or hit the truce gong.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.900
Is it because he understands her

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.140
or he doesn't love her enough?

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.620
Besides, women don't need to be understood

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.260
but to be

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.700
loved truly.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.020
That's to say,

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.700
Minister Pei is the good match for her.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.260
Chen Qianqian,

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.540
how dare you humiliate Pei Heng in public?

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.940
Don't you disapprove

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.420
of my engagement to Pei Heng?

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.260
Do you want me to admit it?

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.380
Of course you can't.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.140
But

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.020
you can't deny it in public either.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.140
What a strange way of thinking.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.660
Twenty-five.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.500
I was often beaten

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.260
by Miss Lin Qi in
the Music and Dance Academy.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.700
Her whipping is top-ranking

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.780
in the whole city.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.300
Now that it was an awful time,

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.180
just don't think about it.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.660
When Miss Lin Qi whips people,

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.420
sometimes their flesh is torn

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.860
and sometimes they suffer internal injuries.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.220
I have no idea

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.700
how she's whipping the Third Princess today.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.180
She'll just get some superficial wounds.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.060
She's Her Majesty's daughter.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.820
Lin Qi won't get herself into trouble.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.220
Stop trying to persuade me.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.660
I'm not going.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.540
It's no business of mine
whether she loses or wins,

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.060
dies or lives.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.340
I don't care

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.540
and I don't want to know.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.420
Your Highness,

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.260
the person you sent to the ring said...

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.460
Nonsense.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.300
Who sent someone there?

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.860
How's Qianqian?

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.940
Her Highness has been badly battered

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.340
but she's still not admitting defeat.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.060
She's forcing me.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.820
Your Highness, do you want to go or not?

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.780
What's the use of going there?

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.500
I'll just be laughed at.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.700
Sorry about this, Your Highness.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.140
What are you doing?

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.060
Zi Nian, catch up.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.700
Yes.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.420
Twenty-seven.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.260
The game's over. You lost.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.340
Yuanyuan.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:34.700
Qianqian.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.700
Qianqian, admit defeat.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:50.340
Rehabilitation.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.260
I promise you.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.540
I'll accept rehabilitation.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.820
Admit defeat.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.540
You'll die if you keep fighting.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.140
Qianqian, listen to me.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.660
Admit defeat now.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.340
It's a competition.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.780
Don't act so pitiful.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.900
Who are you trying to impress?

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.260
As a worthless person,

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.780
I will only be ridiculed
by the whole world no matter what.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.660
You want to make me stand up again.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.500
It's just like you want to win the Kung Fu test
though you are unable to practice Kung Fu.

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.500
Do you think

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.740
it is possible?

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.300
And you'll score one point
higher than Lin Qi.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.620
Even if you two tumble
off the ring at the same time

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:35.740
and draw,

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:36.980
you'll still win

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.460
in the Kung Fu test.

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.260
-Qianqian! -Qianqian!

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.700
Qianqian.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.140
Qianqian.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:03.620
Are you okay?

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.700
Get up. Slowly.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.580
Qianqian.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.900
Chen Qianqian, you crafty woman.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.780
You underestimated me yourself.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.140
Your Highness,

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.620
you've won in the Kung Fu test.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.100
If your discourse on politics
gets the first grade,

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.140
that will be perfect.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.380
Don't turn over. Don't raise your head.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.740
Don't move. Be a good girl.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.140
Don't move.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.980
Lin Qi whipped Qianqian twenty-seven times.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.060
Go and kill her.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:59.780
Cut her twenty-seven times before she dies.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.700
If you do it one time less,

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.580
you'll suffer it for her.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.380
Yes, Young Master.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.180
I'll only cut her more.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.060
Han Shuo.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.180
Bai Ji, come in.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.100
Are...

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.860
are you going to take revenge on Lin Qi?

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:34.940
I...

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:36.660
Listen,

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.580
she deserves more than death.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.300
I know a better way to punish her.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.380
Zi Rui,

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.820
my back itches.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.140
What did the doctor say?

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.820
Yuanyuan has dressed my wounds.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.060
And it doesn't hurt so much.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.420
Don't worry.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:09.820
That's good.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.060
-On the competing ground...
-On the competing ground...

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.820
On the competing ground,

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.980
you couldn't bear to see me being hurt

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.460
so you mentioned our engagement, right?

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.340
I knew it.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.380
I must win this competition

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:50.980
so...

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.020
Wait a minute, Minister Pei.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.340
I hear over the past few years,

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.460
you were indifferent to this engagement,

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.820
but today you mentioned it

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.580
before a crowd of people.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.460
Did you feel forced to do it

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.220
or do you have some ulterior motive?

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.980
So what if I felt forced to do it?

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.060
So what if I have some ulterior motive?

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.420
If you felt forced to do it,

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.340
I'll take that as your concern for your student.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.220
And I'll be grateful to you

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.420
as Qianqian's husband.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.860
If you have some ulterior motive...

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.420
I once suffered from heart disease

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.060
and I couldn't often stay with Qianqian.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.540
Now I've recovered.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.460
Qianqian and I will

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.420
grow old together

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.380
and be with each other forever.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.020
I'd advise you to forget your engagement

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.740
to Qianqian as soon as possible.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.260
Grow old together.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.220
Be with each other forever.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.820
The die is cast.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.700
Now that some things didn't happen,

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.980
they're never gonna happen.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.940
Don't waste your time

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.500
for someone you can't be with.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.380
I think Lin Qi is a good choice.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.820
At least she's devoted to you.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.780
Let me ask you a question, too.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.700
After you moved into Yueli Mansion,

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.740
Qianqian snatched Dragon Bone
and became a commoner for you.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.260
But when she was whipped by Lin Qi,

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.300
you weren't pained a bit.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.100
Are you serious about Qianqian

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.660
or do you have an ulterior motive?

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.100
You're an outsider.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.260
Why should you suspect

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.740
my feelings for Qianqian?

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.060
Qianqian and I have been
engaged for fifteen years.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.540
How come I'm an outsider?

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.540
An engagement you were indifferent to

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.140
and wanted to break off

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.780
is nothing at all.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.460
Her Majesty may not think like that.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.460
Did you just admit that you liked Qianqian?

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.460
It's nothing to be denied.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.580
You didn't care a damn about Qianqian

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.940
but only after I came here

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.900
and took her away from you

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.860
did you pay attention to her.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.660
I can't see that you truly love her.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.580
I may not truly love her before.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.300
But now I definitely do.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.740
Don't resent me for not being nice to you.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.740
Same to you.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.740
Pei Heng admitted that he liked Qianqian

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.220
right in front of me.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.620
Does he really think I don't dare to kill?

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:17.980
Young Master,

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.820
Minister Pei dared to infuriate you

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.500
just because

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.180
he's the only child of
the deceased Minister of Defense.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.060
But don't forget

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.340
that behind you

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.220
is Xuanhu City.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.860
As long as we light the beacon
and march our army here,

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.020
not only the Third Princess

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.540
but also Pei Heng will be yours.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.460
What do I need him for?

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.980
Sorry. Sorry.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:44.860
It hurts.
