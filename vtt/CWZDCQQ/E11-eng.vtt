=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 11)

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.580
(Qingfeng Tea House)

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.180
This Cherry stands for Yingying.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.260
It is the advisor of the Apple.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.900
It seems harmless.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.500
But actually, it keeps its own counsel.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.540
In childhood, Cherry was saved by Apple.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.540
So it fell head over heels for Apple

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.820
and it's very loyal to Apple.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.420
Apple have succeeded in many doings,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.780
which is actually
attributed to Cherry's counsel.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.980
Besides, Apple defeated Banana.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.580
Well, the Third Princess,

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.860
the story is becoming more and more complex.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.060
We haven't sorted out
the triangular relationship

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.140
between Orange, Apple and Banana yet.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.940
Why did you bring in another character?

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.140
It is not complicated.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.020
I brought in Cherry

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.700
to help me sort out the relations
between characters.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.260
It has been written into the original script.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.860
Cherry saw that Apple had a thing for Banana.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.220
Thus, on Weimeng Mountain, Apple tried all means

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.460
like the typical trapping and drugging.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.740
It put all those means
into practice one by one.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.460
Finally, Banana fell into the trap

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.380
and started fancying Apple.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.100
This time, as long as

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.860
Cherry could play its role
on Weimeng Mountain

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.980
as specified in the original plots,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.020
Han Shuo and Chu...

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.300
Then, Banana and Apple

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.300
will come to fruition in love.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.300
Then I will be able to

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.580
rest and wait for the finale.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.300
Now the plots have changed too much.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.780
I am very curious.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.740
How should Cherry act

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.820
to clean up the mess

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.020
made by Orange in the past.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.780
Qianqian.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.900
Be careful.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.860
Su Ziying, how could you?

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.860
I implore you not to misunderstand,
Young Master Han.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.500
I'm just worried that the strong wind

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.060
might cause Her Highness to catch a cold.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.660
If I did anything improper,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.300
please forgive me.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.620
What are you doing?

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.900
Why did you make Yingying kneel down?

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.260
I didn't make him do that.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.460
Your Highness,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.180
I have offended Young Master Han.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.340
So he punished me lightly.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.900
Sorry to have disturbed Your Highness.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.420
When did I punish you?

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.340
Young Master Han,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.620
if you are annoyed with me,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.060
I am willing to be beaten and punished.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.820
However,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.540
you mustn't misunderstand

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.020
my Young Master's kindness to Her Highness.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.340
Did I say a word about Pei Heng?

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.460
Han Shuo,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.820
it is true that Pei Heng sent Yingying here

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.340
only to take care of me.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.180
Moreover,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.340
Yingying is well-behaved and obedient.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.660
Don't always think others
are ill-intentioned.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.460
OK?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.340
Yingying, get into the carriage.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.260
I want to have a talk with you.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.860
Young Master,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.460
you have been thumping your chest these days.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.100
Has your heart disease relapsed?

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.900
It is not the heart disease.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.540
I am suffering from the chest tightness.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.940
Han Shuo,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.420
go consult with Chuchu

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.620
about our itinerary today.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.900
As for you two,

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.900
one is both brainy and brawny

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.820
and the other is good at governing troops.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.740
With you two here,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.660
I feel a lot more at ease.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.740
You two must have a good discussion

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.900
in a detailed fashion.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.740
Have you got it?

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.340
Just go.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.340
Your Highness.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.940
Young Master Han.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.100
Weimeng Mt. features complex terrain
and can be easily guarded.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.180
Do you have any sound strategies

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.220
to ensure an immediate victory.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Meng Guo is pretentious.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.700
Learning that we are coming
suppress his forces,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.260
he won't hole up in the mountain.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.660
Look! We shall get stationed here.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.660
Then we will find a chance to lure him out

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.380
to capture him.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.020
But we still need bait.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.420
In my view, Su Ziying is a good choice.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.940
Su Ziying?

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.460
Just kidding.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.580
Su Ziying is just a humble wretch

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.020
who is adept in artful speech.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.180
What capability and virtue does he have

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.780
to lure Meng Guo down the mountain?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.860
As the Young Master of Xuanhu City,

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.700
I will put the word out

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.100
to get him to come at me by then.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.300
(An aura of orchid's elegance)

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.980
Your Highness,

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.220
here is the sesame paste, ginseng tea,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.540
the pearl barley dew, and the bird's nest.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.820
They are all premium tonics.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.340
In such beautiful days,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.500
only a worthless person like me

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.380
stays at home to kill time.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.620
Life is short.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.460
When can I be freed from all this?

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.140
Your Highness,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.060
don't be self-despising.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.580
The Third Princess is inferior to you.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.980
Even if she has been made Crown Princess,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.580
she continues idling away day in, day out.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.140
Minister Pei just handled
the official documents for her.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.660
Your Highness, Mr. Su is present.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.660
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.820
Why are you here?

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.740
Where is Qianqian?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.020
the Crown Princess has been sent
to Weimeng Mountain to suppress bandits.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.660
She has left at around 8 a.m.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.220
She ordered me

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.620
to accompany you through
the rehabilitation every day.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.300
Qianqian has gone to suppress the bandits?

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.980
Zi Nian,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.500
didn't you say Qianqian

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.980
was idling away all the time?

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.780
I will skip the rehabilitation.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.860
Zi Nian.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.060
Your Highness.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.340
Why are you still here?

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.980
Why is Your Highness so childish?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.660
You wrote your will in the form of diary.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.340
You!

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.300
How dare you!

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.380
You mustn't read them.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.220
Your Highness,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.260
you really

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.900
don't want me to read them?

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.900
Read them if you insist.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.180
This is the first letter.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.940
New Year's Eve in the 9th year
during Empress Fengde's reign

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.380
Her Majesty and my third sister
played on ice.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.300
I was itching for joining them.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.220
Your Highness wanted to go skating.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.340
This is the second one.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.340
Your Highness.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.820
I will read the second one.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.260
The Dragon Boat Festival in the 11th year
during Empress Fengde's reign

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.900
Third sister rode a horse
in the street and fell off it.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.900
I envied her so much.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.660
Your Highness,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.220
so you wanted to ride a horse.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.780
I, your servant can fulfill your wish.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.340
The next one.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.780
The third diary.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.180
Fengde...

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.740
The year is not important.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.380
As Your Highness grew up,

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.620
you wanted to try more and more things.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.300
Fly a kite.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.620
Your Highness,

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.140
you have never flown a kite?

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.580
You also wanted to go to the Music
and Dance Academy.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.060
The Music and Dance Academy

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.180
is not a good place.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.660
But, they all have visited it.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.940
Your Highness need not go there.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.820
Back then, the service of all musicians

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.700
couldn't outdo my hearty smile.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.580
Let me read this last one.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.020
Your Highness

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.500
has put down all your
inner thoughts in the letters.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.060
Now they are dropped onto the ground.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.700
What a pity!

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.900
I just put down some random thoughts.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.780
As long as Your Highness agrees to practice

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.300
referring to the brochure given by the Crown Princess,

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.660
I will try my best

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.340
to enable you to ride a horse,
go skating and fly a kite.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.740
Besides,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.900
you need not go to the Music
and Dance Academy.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.580
No matter what the musicians there can do,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.540
I can do the same, too.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.100
I didn't want to go there.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.620
I just wrote the words randomly.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.780
You are holding one in your hands.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.500
No matter what wish

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.380
you have put down in the letter,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.540
I will help you fulfill your wish.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.340
Really?

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.180
Sure.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.340
Your Highness,

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.980
are you thinking that I come from
the Music and Dance Academy,

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.380
so I am used to cheating women

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.380
and breaking my words?

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.540
Of course not.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.020
You are not like others.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.020
Forget it.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.220
You don't know

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.260
what I wrote in this letter at all.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.140
I won't take your words seriously.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.540
Then, for the next, we shall...

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.820
Let's practice.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.740
OK.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.220
Mr. Su,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.260
from now on,

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.020
you will be our
Risheng Mansion's honored guest.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.180
It is the Crown Princess's duty
to suppress the bandits.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.220
How come in the end,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.860
it has become your business?

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.100
She is the Crown Princess.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.380
Though you're working for her,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.340
by then, she will take all the credit.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.860
But if things go wrong,
you will be held accountable.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:39.980
It is unfair.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:40.940
Never mind.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.020
It is no use saying these words now.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.020
Don't you think the air in this carriage

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.100
is oxygen-deficient?

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.900
I think it is too crowded

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.060
for three people.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.980
Let one of us get out.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.980
I am a humble servant.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.860
I will get out.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.420
Nonetheless,

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.940
it has been a long travel.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.780
Her Highness must have been tired.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.260
I have mastered the massage.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.980
You can do that?

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.300
A small piece of cake.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.820
Could you please get out to ride the horse?

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.860
I want the massage.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.420
I can do it, too.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.300
I will give you the massage.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.660
In my memory, you can't.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.740
I can.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.820
What are you doing?

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.500
Let him massage me first.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.700
Then I will learn it.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.140
Han Shuo, you can't bully Yingying.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.500
Who bullied him?

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.300
He likes kneeling down.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.780
Maybe Pei Heng taught him to do so.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.700
For no reason,

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.980
why did you mention Pei Heng again?

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.340
Pei Heng! Pei Heng! Pei Heng!

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.500
Your Highness,

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.740
don't bicker with

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.340
Young Master Han for my sake.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.740
We didn't quarrel, right?

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.700
No, we didn't.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.620
We didn't.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.140
You want a massage, right?

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.660
I will massage you.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.140
Why does one man pick on another man?

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.540
It feels good!

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.220
This letter

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.620
was written when the Third Princess got married.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.580
If my memory doesn't lie to me,

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.660
Your Highness made a wish that

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.020
you could find someone to love.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.780
Su Mu didn't know his inferiority

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.460
and dared to promise you this.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.500
Geez! Your Highness!

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.660
Have you fallen for him?

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.980
He is the number one
of the Music and Dance Academy.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.260
He is just a musician.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.940
He doesn't look down upon me.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.380
Why should I make light of him?

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.660
As long as the man is good to Your Highness

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.940
and makes Your Highness happy,

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.220
he will be the right one.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.100
God, please bless Her Highness
with early recovery

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.020
and may her wishes come true.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.820
Take care.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.700
Our inn

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.340
used to enjoy business boom.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.300
Since the bandits on the Weimeng Mountain

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.900
began to harass the passing trade caravans,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:28.820
well,

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.220
our business has been stagnant.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.940
Our inn is old and in bad repair.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.300
We can only provide
a limited number of rooms.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.780
I don't know what arrangements I should make.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.380
Prepare three high-quality rooms

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.580
for my master and the two princesses.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.660
Three rooms?

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.540
Won't Young Master
and the Crown Princess share one room?

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.580
Right. Then the Crown Princess and I will...

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.660
You asked too much.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.220
My master made such arrangements

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.700
for his own purpose.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.100
I got it.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.380
I will do it right away.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.660
Bai Ji,

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.260
what is my purpose on earth?

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.780
It hurts a lot.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.620
Young Master,

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.580
you have taken the drastic measure.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.220
Though the Crown Princess is important,

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.340
what is on your mind now

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.980
should be the forces of Weimeng Mountain.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.420
You want to take this chance
to subdue Meng Guo

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.420
to make him work for you

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.660
and make him escort the trade caravans
of our Xuanhu City.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.300
It is a serious matter.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.260
I guess you don't want the Crown Princess to know it.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.940
So you must take separate rooms.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.500
Young Master, is my analysis right?

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.020
Yes.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.980
I have such a plan indeed.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.460
Young Master, you are circumspect
and far-sighted.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.620
Young Master, you are wise.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.580
Looking back smilingly,

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.820
a lady that is so slim and graceful.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.940
Her eyes are slightly-parted

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.820
looking like bows in the moonlight.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.020
In the deep forest of the back mountain,

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.300
I will wait for your arrival, my lady.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500
Holding a sword with a heroic bearing,

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.460
a man looks so imposing.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.860
Spurring a horse with the raised whip,

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.940
a man seems so domineering.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.020
In the deep forest of the back mountain,

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.580
I will wait for your arrival, dear sir.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.460
You two,

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.540
hand over

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.060
one letter to Chuchu

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.580
and the other to Young Master Han.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.620
Remember

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.260
not to let others know

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.260
I wrote them.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.340
Got it.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.140
Let the plots

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.260
develop more quickly and surprisingly.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.900
Declaring love on Weimeng Mountain.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.620
A lady that is so slim and graceful.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.060
He asked me to meet him on the back mountain.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.500
Why did the Second Princess
ask you to the back mountain?

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.180
Holding a sword with a heroic bearing.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.900
Could it be possible that

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.500
she wants us to...

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.420
Laugh!

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:19.980
Laugh out aloud!

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.380
This is how an idol drama should be.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.020
Such a feast to eyes.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.260
Your Highness.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.580
Young Master Han, why did you

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.940
ask me to meet you here?

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.020
Your Highness, please strike.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.900
Strike?

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.420
Since you mentioned holding a sword,

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.660
I guess our battle in the Music
and Dance Academy,

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.060
has failed to satisfy you.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.140
Taking this chance,

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.420
let's battle it out again.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.700
We are facing the fight with the bandits.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.820
It suits the occasion.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.180
Battle it out?

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.500
Isn't this a date?

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.540
The Music and Dance Academy... Battle...

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.140
So I misunderstood it.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.100
You didn't.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.780
Han Shuo did.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.140
Your Highness, please strike.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.220
It doesn't matter.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.260
The hero and heroine

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.820
may fall for each other
while crossing swords.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.220
In the martial art competition,

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.500
they will exchange blows

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.340
and can't avoid physical contact.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.620
Thus, they may develop feelings
for each other.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.940
As I said.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:34.860
Go on!

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.620
This is not good.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.300
The idol drama is turning
into the Kung Fu drama.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.380
You should go easy on her.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.900
How can you be so serious

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.380
when battling with a girl?

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.500
You won't be popular with girls.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.220
What should I do? What should I do?

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.340
I got distracted.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.980
Please punish me, Your Highness.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.620
Who is there? Show yourself.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.420
Me.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.580
It is me.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.860
Qianqian.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.340
You...

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:28.940
I

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.140
was passing by.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:32.980
By chance,

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.300
by accident and without intention,

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.460
I saw you and Chuchu battling here.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.740
So I hid myself quietly

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.860
not to disturb you.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.900
Then I watched you for a while.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.740
Master Han, you fought so valiantly.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.660
Chuchu,

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.940
you have fought hard.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.660
In this battle, you two

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:56.740
can be said to

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.580
be a good match,

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.660
to be equal in strength,

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.180
to be on a par

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.220
and to be similarly skilled in martial arts.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.100
Bravo!

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:05.740
You are a heaven-made match.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.740
A heaven-made match. A perfect match.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.500
I am not on a par with her.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.660
I won just now.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.100
So Young Master Han, you asked me to meet you here

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.660
for the purpose of showing me up.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.260
No, it is not like that, Chuchu.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.100
Don't you see... second sister...

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.420
Did I fight bravely just now?

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.500
Yes.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.100
Then I will feel assured.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.100
Didn't you see I was just being polite?

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.940
Chuchu is a girl of noble birth.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.860
But you humiliated her so much.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.340
She must be very sad now.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.700
Since we were in a battle,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.180
if I had gone easy on her,

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.940
that would have been disrespect to her.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.500
So, do you mean that

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.740
if I hadn't stopped you,

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.220
you would have beaten her up.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.620
Since it was a friendly battle,

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.540
I wouldn't hurt her.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.660
Her life would not be in danger.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.700
Besides, she is your sister. I...

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.540
I got it.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.900
You are blaming me
for applying too much strength.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:51.860
It is my fault.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.060
I shouldn't have given you
the one-track-minded persona.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.820
A person like you

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.620
is basically not fit for the idol drama.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.260
Well, what am I not fit for?

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.060
Your Highness,

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.260
wait for me!

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.020
Master Han, in our Huayuan City,

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.860
there is a saying, a man's best dowry

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.580
is his chastity, purity and self-respect.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.180
Please act prudently in the coming days,

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.780
observe the men's ethics,

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.420
and try not to rile the Third Princess.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.620
I...

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.020
Young Master, what did Su Ziying mean?

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.820
He might mean that...

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.620
Qianqian thought I met
the Second Princess for a date.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.460
It seems that it is a wise move for me

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.140
to have brought her to suppress the bandits.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.300
She

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.940
got jealous of me.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.620
Yingying, you have seen it.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.260
What do you think of

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.060
the relation between Han Shuo
and my second sister?

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.060
I think that

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.340
Xuanhu City and Huayuan City
have different folk customs.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.220
Are Your Highness also suspecting that

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.700
Master Han is harboring evil designs?

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:12.940
He isn't harboring any ill intent.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.180
Because from the very beginning,

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.500
he has been acting oddly.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.300
Normally,

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.260
he should be closer to Chuchu.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.980
I don't understand.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.940
Help me figure out a way

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.300
to push Han Shuo to Chuchu's side.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.260
Your Highness, I have been
taught by Mr. Pei

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.100
to be kind to people and behave properly.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.620
I dare not do improper things.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.260
Don't pretend in front of me.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.900
Because you are resourceful,

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.380
I brought you here to suppress the bandits.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.140
You can take it that

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.180
I

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.900
got tired of Han Shuo

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.700
and asked you to figure out a solution for me

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.180
to scuttle our marriage.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:57.700
Such is the thing.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.300
Since Your Highness gave me the order,

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.620
I would go through fire and water to do it.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.020
But I am slow-witted.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.340
How should I do it?

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.140
Please give me instructions, Your Highness.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.180
When suppressing bandits,
perils are unavoidable.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.780
I think the love between two people

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.780
will be born out of mutual trust

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.500
and interdependence.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.140
They...

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.380
Rest assured, Your Highness.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.460
I got it. I will do as you said.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.620
He got it.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.500
But I haven't got it quite well.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.980
Something is happening.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.580
Report!

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:07.740
Your Highness,

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.020
while Young Master Han was leading
the troops on patrol,

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.460
they were ambushed by the bandits.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.460
Zi Zhu,

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.740
you lead men to aid Young Master Han.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.860
I will go check the situation
and come right away.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.060
Be careful, Your Highness.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.460
Young Master, haven't you been ambushed?

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:53.820
What ambush?

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.940
Where is the Second Princess?

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.020
Report came that

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.860
you have been ambushed by the bandits.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.380
So the Second Princess sent me to aid you.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.460
Where is the messenger?

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.380
I am afraid Meng Guo
is trying to lure us away.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.580
The Second Princess is in danger now.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.740
Zi Zhu, lead the way.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.460
Yes, sir!

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.500
If mother comes to know that

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.020
in the course of suppressing bandits,

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.780
I fall into the trap accidentally

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.220
and fail to complete the mission,

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.180
she will surely scold me.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:27:59.860
Master Han,

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.060
could the mountain bandits have arrived

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.620
and she's been taken by Meng Guo?

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.260
Qianqian and her second sister are close.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.580
She can't bear to see her sister in danger.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:06.860
Let's find her first.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.020
Master Han, why are you here?

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.620
I came to save you.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.780
Your leg has got hurt.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.260
Let me help you handle it.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.660
Your Highness is brave and strong.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.060
If Qianqian was in your position,

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.500
she would cry loudly.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:13.940
You lied to me, Young Master Han.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.300
Qianqian fears no pain.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:16.820
Come on.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.500
Sorry to trouble you, Young Master Han.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.140
Don't mention it.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:26.860
Your foot just got better.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.300
I will carry you up on my back.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.780
Thank you, Young Master Han.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.260
Zi Rui,

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.340
I saw some food stock in the kitchen.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.620
So I wanted to cook congee
for the Third Princess tomorrow morning.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.260
But I am not good at cooking.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.940
I can't even cook the congee.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.340
OK. I will work on it.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.580
The Third Princess, I got everything done.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.660
At this time, Young Master Han and the Second Princess

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.260
should be having a good time together.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.980
It happened so fast.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.180
Come on.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.460
In childhood, I took Qianqian
for pack hunting.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.260
She liked this kind of wild fruit best.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.580
Does she still like it?

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.060
Who knows?

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.580
Her feelings for things never last long.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.780
Why did you pack it?

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.060
I will bring it back to Qianqian.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.380
She is not used to the cold food
for the marching troops.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.340
If I had known Young Master Han
is so brave and handsome

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.580
as well as is so devoted to love,

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.420
I shouldn't have let Qianqian have you.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.180
Why did you say so, Your Highness?

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.700
Back then, when you entered our city,

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.780
mother intended to marry me to you.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.020
But Qianqian was taking you
by force in the street,

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.140
which resulted in your marriage
with her by chance.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.700
This is the trick fate played on us.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.100
If I were given another chance,

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.740
I hope I would
be riding a horse in the street

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.220
and be taking you from the street.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.380
If time could go back,

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.780
what would be your choice, Young Master Han?

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.300
Though I came to know Qianqian by accident,

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.100
after a series of happenings,

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.060
I have developed deep feelings for her.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.900
If there were a second chance,

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.780
I would still choose Qianqian,
who is pure-hearted,

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.540
upright and kind.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.900
With your talent, Your Highness,

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.540
you will definitely make
great achievements in the future.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.060
Your Highness, I wish that

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.700
you could enjoy endless blessings.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.660
Just as I expected.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.740
People in the whole Huayuan City

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.620
know you love Qianqian.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.940
But she doesn't know herself.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.900
Qianqian

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.580
is pure-hearted.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.580
There is a place for me in her heart.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.260
On the marching journey,
we can't make a fire.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.820
Sorry to make you suffer.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.740
Thank you, Young Master Han.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.900
Though I am a noble princess,

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.700
people seldom treat me so nicely.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.620
You can't be serious, Your Highness.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.940
Qianqian

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.940
has been loved by all people since childhood.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.380
She is spoiled and willful

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.500
while I am used
to currying favor with people.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.100
Mother hasn't been good to me

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.580
as she has been nice to Qianqian.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.900
Qianqian doesn't take anything to heart,

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.380
but she has everything.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.740
I tried my best in everything,

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.060
but I got nothing.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.020
Young Master Han, tell me,

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.180
is this my destiny?

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.660
You are just having a hard time temporarily.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.580
Don't mind it too much.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.740
Things will change for the better

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.460
and you will have your moments.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.780
People in the whole Huayuan City

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.740
know you love Qianqian.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.900
But she doesn't know herself.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.780
Qianqian is pure-hearted.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.660
There is a place for me in her heart.

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.460
Is it true that

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.580
Qianqian doesn't know my feelings?

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.260
They didn't come back last night.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.580
Does a date have to take so long?

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.580
Where have you led them?

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.580
They fell into a trap.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.020
Trap?

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.700
Who dug it?

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.500
You dug it?

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.020
Isn't this your idea, Your Highness?

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.180
My idea?

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.420
When suppressing bandits,
traps are unavoidable.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.740
When suppressing bandits,
perils are unavoidable.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.300
Don't you know?

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.340
You took traps for perils.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.060
I made a mistake.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.620
But you said that

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.020
two people' feelings

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.540
are born out of mutual trust

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.060
and interdependence.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.860
That doesn't mean you can dig a pit

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:15.860
and bury them.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.340
If Meng Guo passed by

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.860
and filled up the pit with earth,

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.660
they would lose their lives.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.140
I have been careless.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.420
Please punish me, Your Highness.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.260
How should I?

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.340
Where did you trap them? Go save them!

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:27.860
Hurry!

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.220
the Crown Princess, the Crown Princess.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.380
Look at the food I prepared for you.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:33.620
It is congee? Why?

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.460
You made a fire?

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.220
When I went to cook the congee this morning,

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.100
the pot had been put above the fire.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.260
You made the fire?

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.060
It has been a tiring journey.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.060
Seeing Your Highness could only eat cold food

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.460
and had no hot meals,

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.020
I decided to cook a bowl of congee

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.220
to warm your stomach.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.140
While on the march,

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.740
in order to keep our traces secret,

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.820
we are forbidden to make a fire.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.460
Hurry to circulate the order.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.820
Set out immediately!

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.100
If Meng Guo came to attack,

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.340
in the absence of Han Shuo and Chuchu, I...

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.020
Well,

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.100
I have to lead some men to save them.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.660
In case that Meng Guo find them first...

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.340
Report!

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.820
Your Highness,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.620
the mountain bandits are coming at us.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:13.980
They are coming?

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.780
Run! Run! Run!

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.060
Well. Well.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:29.060
Capture Chen Qianqian! Make her my wife!

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:29.820
Hurry! Hurry!

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:31.780
Be careful!

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.580
What should we do?

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.780
Your Highness, run away quickly!

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.980
I will cover for you.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.260
Get out of here quickly!

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.540
I am...

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.460
No! No! No! I am not.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.460
Your Highness, take flight!

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:48.180
Your Highness!

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.500
Shut up!

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.060
Your Highness!

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.980
Your Highness! Run! Your Highness!

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:35.820
Are you all right?

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.020
Go help Chuchu quickly!

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.700
Are you kidding?

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.820
How can I leave you alone?

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:42.900
Don't mind me.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:43.820
It is not easy for you to have a chance

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.740
to spend a whole night
with Chuchu in the trap.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:45.780
Hurry to help her.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.100
How do you know we were in the trap?

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.020
Han Shuo, are you all right?

00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.860
-Zi Rui, take Qianqian somewhere to hide.
-Does it hurt?

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:00.380
-Yes! -Han Shuo!

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:00.820
Hurry!

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.340
Does it hurt?

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:01.740
Hurry!

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.460
Han Shuo!

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.860
Report to Your Highness.

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.820
Here is Meng Guo,
ringleader of the Weimeng Mountain bandits.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.380
Weimeng Mountain is located at the junction

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.740
of Huayuan City and Xuanhu City.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.700
Our trade caravans pass it inevitably.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.220
Meng Guo occupies it and robs the passers-by.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.780
The passing trade caravans suffer a lot.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.260
Now he is captured.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.460
How should we deal with him?

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.020
Han Shuo,
hurry to put in a good word for him.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:42.700
In the original script,

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.900
Meng Guo was a right-hand man of you.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.060
Since he is caught, he should be killed.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.900
Mother sent us here

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.620
for nothing else, but this matter.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.300
Why is "kill" said so easily?

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.340
It is frightening.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.780
In your opinion, the Crown Princess,

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.540
what should we do with him?

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.140
I...

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.180
How about your opinion, Young Master Han?

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.500
Young Master Han, do you want this man?

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.140
Fine. I will keep him alive.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.780
Keep him...

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.380
A real man can be killed, but not humiliated.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.340
It is a pity that I was defeated.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.100
Otherwise,

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.220
I will take her to my mountain

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.820
and make her my wife.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.900
We can live a happy life.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.580
Take my banner here.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:38.620
Where is my banner?

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:39.980
What banner?

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:40.740
I don't know.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.260
Capture Chen Qianqian!

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.900
Make her my wife!

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.540
Then he should be beheaded.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.300
Behead?

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.700
Well, don't you want him to work for you?

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.740
Think about the forces
and mines of Weimeng Mountain.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.180
Don't give up on him.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.500
He harbors ill intent towards you.

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.700
If you don't want him, I will.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.300
Meng Guo has evil designs and occupies
the mountain for brigandage.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.340
He not only persecutes the people,

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.980
but also wants to make you his wife by force.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.300
You are dreaming.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.420
I was inspired.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.140
Meng Guo is a good name.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.660
I suddenly recalled an allusion.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.340
Have you ever heard...

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.460
Who?

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.940
Have, have you heard of

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.380
Zhuge Kongming?

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.420
Who is it?

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.380
A military counselor.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.100
Shall I invite him here?

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.500
No need. I am capable enough.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.780
Free him.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.540
Why?

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.860
Why are you still in the mood
to ask about the reason?

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.060
Do you want to be beheaded?

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.980
Kill me if you want to.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.900
Today I just brought a small troop

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.220
to gather military intelligence.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.900
I find that your military camps a-a-re

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.180
neglectful of necessary precautions.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.180
Thus, I launched a surprise attack.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:53.820
It is really a pity.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.420
You can behead me.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.900
My men on Weimeng Mountain will revenge me.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.780
Did, did you hear?

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.580
If we kill Meng Guo today,

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.860
the bandits will lose their leader.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.460
It will be a serious problem in the future.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.980
It will be harder for us to deal with them.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.860
Based on the strength
of Young Master Han and Chuchu,

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.380
it must be easy to catch the bandits.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.180
However, what matters now is

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.260
we have to make them stop

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.060
seizing others' possessions.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.540
We should persuade them to work for us.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.300
Free him.

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:34.740
Nothing matters as long as Qianqian is fine.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:37.300
Hurry!

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:41.340
I know how to walk.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.220
Get out of my way.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.580
Are you sure it will work, Qianqian?

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:49.820
Yes.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.940
Meng Guo is meant to be caught seven times.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.220
Then he will be freed seven times.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.820
After that, he will submit willingly.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:02.460
Sorry.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:04.220
I got you distracted.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.020
I am to blame for this.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.340
I haven't come back earlier.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.180
Just now, you wanted to

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.300
block the sword attack for me.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.460
I saw it clearly.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.580
It doesn't matter.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.740
From now on, in no case

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.660
can you do this again.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.260
There is something else

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.700
to be clarified.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.460
Last night, Young Master Han and I were out there.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.940
Who exposed our campsite
and led Meng Guo here?

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.420
Cooked the congee?

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.060
Bring Su Ziying here!

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.180
I will punish him severely.
