=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 8)

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.140
(Xiangtai Restaurant)

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.580
Give me a grape.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.940
The biggest one.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.700
Give me a date.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.980
Why is it so noisy there?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.100
Suddenly there was a loud bang.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.540
Guess what?

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.300
What's up?

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.700
There was an explosion in the mine.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.700
The Third Princess saw it.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.980
She rushed to the exit.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.740
She began to remove the stones by hand

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.660
to save the people below.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.020
It was not long before

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.100
Lin Qi, along with her family,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.100
hurried to the scene.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.300
Lin Qi

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.620
had been at odds
with the Third Princess since childhood.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.860
Now,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.980
she saw the Third Princess had destroyed
her family's black stone mine.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.500
She got very furious.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.660
Would she let it go easily?

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.620
Definitely not.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.580
No.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.260
Yeah.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.380
Lin Qi gnashed her teeth and said:

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.700
"Whoever kills the Third Princess
will get huge reward."

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.340
Huge reward?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.260
Do you know

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.220
what the Third Princess was doing at that time?

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.140
What?

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.220
She took no notice of Lin Qi's words

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.900
and still kept removing
the stones like crazy.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.700
Her ten fingers were bleeding heavily

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.060
with her skin cut open and flesh torn.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.660
You could even see the bones inside.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.940
The knuckles were also disjointed.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.860
But she didn't stop.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.980
She kept removing the stones.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.820
She was intent on saving all the people.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.940
Just at the critical moment when Lin Qi
and everyone surrounded the Third Princess

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.660
and were about to kill her,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.780
luckily, Young Master Han was by her side

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.980
and protected her.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.340
Wearing a plain blue topcoat

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.980
and holding a Breeze Sword in hand,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.820
Young Master Han was like a real killer

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.460
with awe-inspiring looking
and bellicose presence.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.380
With him guarding a place,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.100
even ten thousand people
could not get through.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.380
Great.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.020
He wielded the sword,
all the people fell to the ground.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.900
Blood flowed like a river.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.580
Wherever his sword went,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.980
all living creatures

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.140
became dead bodies.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.060
It was like a living hell.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.780
Why was Young Master Han so powerful?

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.100
Who was his teacher and where was he from?

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.700
If you want to learn more,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.820
please listen to the next chapter.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.140
Tell us more.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.900
Yeah. Tell us more. I want to hear it.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.420
Let me eat it myself.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.220
Is it good?

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.220
I also want it.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.340
Do you want it?

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.940
Not for you.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.460
So sweet.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.220
You want me to eat this?

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.780
It's enough. It'll be a waste of food
if you cannot finish it off.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.300
There was merely an explosion
in our family's mine.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.620
Why do I have to be treated like this?

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.260
Lady, I know that

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.260
you and the Third Princess have been
fighting with each other since childhood.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.380
Even though you've never won
in all these years,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.860
you just ended up breaking something
or losing some money.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.500
It was no big deal.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.980
But since the Third Princess got married,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.820
she was like getting God's help.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.660
Lady, look at this account book.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.420
It's all in the red.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.020
It's all caused by the Third Princess.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.300
Our family has lost

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.300
the Music and Dance Academy and the mine.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.460
Now, we have only the restaurant
to barely get by.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.940
Lady, you'd better

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.740
live a more frugal life later.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.700
Chen Qianqian...

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.460
(Blew up the Fortune Lode - Found the Black Water Mine -)

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.620
(Solved the Problem - Twist - Saved the miners)

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.700
Blew up the fortune lode,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.860
saved the miners,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.100
found the black water mine

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.860
and solved her own problem.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.580
Suddenly, the story has taken a new twist.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.460
What a drama!

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.780
But none of these things
were done by the heroine.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.540
Had I known it,
I would have persuaded Chuchu to do more,

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.900
which could have brought more credit to her

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.020
and made it more possible

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.060
for her to be the City Owner.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.820
At that time, your life was in dire danger.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.660
But you were still thinking
about other person's credit.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.700
Pei Heng.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.100
I have just said that I would express
my gratitude personally to you.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.900
I didn't expect you to come.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.460
The other day,

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.900
it was you who took me out.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.140
There is no need for us
to say thank you to each other.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.460
Qianqian.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.060
Now, everyone holds you

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.300
in deep respect.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.460
You deserve to be the Third Princess.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.820
There're so many people saying it

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.100
that I feel embarrassed.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.940
Many people?

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.460
Who else?

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.900
Han Shuo?

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.340
The other day I saw Han Shuo
step forward bravely to protect you.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.940
For the first time I admired
men from Xuanhu City.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.700
They can learn literary knowledge,
practice Kung Fu and lead troops in a battle.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.380
In times of crisis,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.100
they can

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.620
step forward to protect their women.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.140
It doesn't matter that
you don't practice Kung Fu.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.580
I don't practice Kung Fu.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.580
What's more,

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.580
it's not that only those who practice Kung Fu

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.820
can lead troops in a battle.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.940
Pei Heng, do you believe me?

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.380
Believe you in what?

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.460
I have a hunch that

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.260
in the future you will be a

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.540
famous leader of the City Guards,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.340
taking on the mantle
of Minister of Defense Pei.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.660
Minister of Defense?

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.580
But in Huayuan City,

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.860
there has never been a man
who became Minister of Defense.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.060
Whatever you do, there'll be the first time.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.140
Why can't you be the first one?

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.580
What's more,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.300
although you are a man,

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.580
you have taken the position
of Minister of Education.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.740
It's unprecedented in history.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.740
One's prospect is not related to his gender.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.100
Not related to his gender?

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.980
It's just like when you
were saving those miners

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.700
you didn't consider whether the people below

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.620
was a man or a woman.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.500
Yes.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.140
No wonder after Her Majesty
resumed your identity,

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.220
she asked me to oversee your learning.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.380
She places great hopes
on your Crown Princess Election.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.100
Qianqian.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.620
If you get the first place
in the Crown Princess Election

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.700
and become the Crown Princess,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.140
you can surely take on great responsibilities
of all common people.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.940
After making such a scene,

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.260
I still cannot avoid Crown Princess Election.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.940
No. I won't go.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.100
I won't take the test.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.620
Do not fall short of everyone's expectations.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.380
I think that those people
who made me offer sacrifice to Heaven

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.540
are the same ones as those

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.940
who now want me to join Crown Princess Election.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.260
No matter which I choose, offering sacrifice to Heaven
or joining the Crown Princess Election,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.100
they don't want me to feel good.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.100
Better late than never.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.980
I'll help you get the first place
in the election.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.460
But I don't have the least intention
of being the Crown Princess.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.580
(Aiming High)

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.980
There are so many books.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.340
Han Shuo, you don't need to come.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.700
Be careful.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.460
It is related to the Third Princess' future.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.820
Minister Pei...

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.740
Even an outsider like
Minister Pei comes to help you.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.420
I am the male owner of Yueli Mansion.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.940
Without doubt,

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.460
I must help her.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:32.500
Qianqian.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.500
The character has been wrongly written.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.540
(Noble birth, Spur the horse, Safe and sound)

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.940
Which one?

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.940
This one.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.540
It should be like this.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.100
Now when I write a stroke on your back,

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.220
you write the same one on the paper.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.500
Okay, done.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:14.540
(Respectful form of you)

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.460
It's correct this time.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.580
"Ni(you)" should be above "Xin(heart)"
(A pun, also means you are in my heart.)

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.340
Well, you'd better

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.140
help me with my homework immediately.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:25.780
Qianqian.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.500
I studied

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.620
all the literary test paper
of Crown Princess Election

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.420
and found some regular patterns in it.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.140
On this basis,

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.340
I drafted some test questions

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.300
and made comments on them.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.420
If you have any question,

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.900
make sure to ask me.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.260
Recently, you should resist
the temptation to play.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.820
The literary test is the first part
of the Crown Princess Election.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.940
You can't afford to be careless.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.620
So many questions!

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.220
It seems that Minister Pei
does not know Qianqian very well.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.380
(Pei Heng's Election Test Outline)

00:11:59.380 --> 00:11:59.700
(Northern Xia Prince Han Shuo's Account Book)

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.340
There are so many questions here.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:02.980
She won't try to answer these questions,

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.220
nor will she even take a look at them.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.300
It's good that I also looked through

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.220
all the literary test paper
of the Crown Princess Election.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.740
I also found some regular patterns

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.980
and drafted some test questions.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.540
But they are all in this slim volume.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.580
These questions are all carefully chosen.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.700
If you memorize all the questions in it,

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.260
you can easily pass the test.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.540
You carefully chose these questions.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.380
Are you predicting the test questions or
are you simply revealing the questions?

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.180
Tell me the truth.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.940
Did you get these questions illegally,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.620
like, if discovered,
you would be sent to prison?

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.820
You can rest assured that

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.420
if you study this book carefully,

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.580
you will surely pass the test.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.900
Young Master Han, I think you are overconfident.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.020
You know that

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.300
this test is related to Qianqian's future

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.860
and she should never be
too careless when dealing with it.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.340
Then you should urge her

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.020
to spend more time on it.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.260
Yes.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.620
If time permits, she can take her time.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.900
But it's less than ten days
before the Crown Princess Election.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.740
Do you think she has the ability to

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.180
memorize so many questions?

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.660
If she can't,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.220
all your efforts are in vain.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.420
Let's not get personal here.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.980
I have a good brain.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.820
Qianqian.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.500
Why don't you memorize
the questions in this volume today

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.220
and prove that to Young Master Han?

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.180
What Young Master Han said makes sense.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.540
I haven't got much brain.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.060
Minister Pei.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.100
You missed the mark.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.220
It turns out that I know Qianqian better.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.660
I grew up with Qianqian

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.660
since childhood.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.980
She is being self-deprecating.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.380
I've been married with her for many days.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.900
She is very different from

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.420
who she was before.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.780
I don't think...

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.860
Why do you think that

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.460
the person you know

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.420
is real "her"?

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.300
Whether the person is real "her" or not,

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.020
I will have time to figure it out.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.820
Don't bother yourself about it.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.260
Qianqian.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.220
(Qingfeng Tea House)

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.140
The Second Princess, the Third Princess.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.460
Guess who can win?

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.700
Make a bet now.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.380
Make a bet now.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.740
Once you bet, keep your hands off the table.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.020
The Second Princess, the Third Princess.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.660
Get out of my way.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.660
The Second Princess or the Third Princess?

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.460
The Third Princess is kind and intelligent.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.860
She must be a good City Owner.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.260
She can write script for storytelling.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.580
She has a sense of affection,
loyalty and responsibility.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.500
Who are you betting on?

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.580
We will surely bet on

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.180
Your Highess.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.180
Give me a receipt.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.100
Excuse me,

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.540
you...

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.420
you have no confidence

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.020
in the Third Princess, do you?

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.140
Are you kidding?

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.780
Why don't you bet on her
if you have confidence in her?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.900
You'll lose a lot of money.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.060
Let's get out of here.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.500
Do we have to

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.420
wait for the Third Princess to write script?

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.540
We will soon get a lot of money.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.660
We don't need to serve
wealthy people anymore.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.420
Let's go.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.220
Come on.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.740
Getting rich overnight without working.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.820
Is it true?

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.460
Let me see.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.940
Your Highness.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.460
This is

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.660
big seasoned durian-flavoured thin-skin
melon seeds straight out of the oven.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.220
This pack is for you.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.180
This pack

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.500
will be given to Young Master Han as you ordered.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.420
Excuse me, Miss?

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.220
Who did you bet on?

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.740
You mean the Crown Princess Election?

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.060
This side is for the Third Princess.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.460
That side is for the Second Princess.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.620
You can put the stake on the one you like.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.820
I'll bet.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.140
There is no stake here.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.060
The majority's view is proved to be correct.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.780
Make a bet on the Second Princess.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.540
You will surely win.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.180
Everyone knows that

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.340
the Third Princess is an ignorant naughty girl.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.340
Yes.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.180
Although the Third Princess made some progress

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.940
and found the black water mine,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.740
the Second Princess is good at writing,
Kung Fu, riding and shooting.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.620
When it comes to the Crown Princess Election,

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.540
the Second Princess is sure
to win in every aspect.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:16.940
That makes sense.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.580
I'll bet on her.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.380
Boss.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.540
I'll bet all my money on

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.660
the Second Princess Chen Chuchu.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.020
Miss, a verbal statement is no guarantee.
Where is your money?

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.180
Wait a second.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.660
Zi Rui, come here!

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:33.740
Go back and

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.540
bring all the valuable things here.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.380
Be quick!

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.740
Your Highness, you'd better think it over.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.780
Don't worry.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.980
After the Crown Princess Election,

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.820
we will have nice sleep and

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.700
amass a great wealth.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.540
Go quickly.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.220
I'll go right now.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.700
Be quick.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.020
(Qingfeng Tea House)

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.460
Excuse me.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.500
I did see Zi Rui sneak in just now.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.580
Thank you.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.420
Be sure to make a good count.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.740
I bet all my money on
the Second Princess Chen Chuchu.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.100
Who is it?

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.100
Han Shuo.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.220
Qianqian.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.780
How did you recognize me?

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.060
I should have dressed you up.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.100
We should learn a lesson next time.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.020
Next time?

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.540
No, no next time.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.700
I'll go back quickly
to study the test questions

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.020
and prepare for
the Crown Princess Election carefully.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.540
I won't let you and Minister Pei...

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.420
Actually the person I mean is you.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.620
You're the most important.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.340
I won't let you down.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.220
Well.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.140
Where are the melon seeds for Young Master Han?

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.940
Look, I went out

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.820
especially to buy melon seeds for you.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.180
Don't blame me.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.460
That's not true.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.500
The Third Princess

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.660
is obviously fooling Young Master Han.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.740
No, she isn't.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.860
This is specially prepared for Young Master Han.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.380
Now I'm gonna go back and

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.460
review my lessons carefully.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.420
Bye-bye.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.700
Excuse me. Make some room for us.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.020
Even out the stakes between them.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.660
Even out the stakes?

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.100
Chuchu.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.020
Chuchu. I'm coming.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.780
The tea house is having a bet
on the Crown Princess Election.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.780
Do you know that?

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.220
Yes, I do.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.460
You have just regained
your position as a princess

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.460
and became popular among people
because of the mine disaster.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.500
Why did you bet on me?

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.500
Do you really have no confidence in yourself?

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.860
Chuchu, look at me. Who am I?

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.340
I am Qianqian,

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.900
who has kept causing trouble
day and night since childhood.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.860
How could this kind of person like me

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.820
be the Crown Princess?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.780
Don't look down upon yourself.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.660
But Chuchu,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.300
these things are widely known.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.820
Chuchu, I'm expecting highly of you.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.980
I bet all my money on you.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.100
You must...

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.900
I am looking forward to making
a lot of money by betting on you.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.100
Do you really think so?

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.420
Definitely.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.420
Not only me,

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.860
mother must think so too.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.500
Mother is usually strict with you.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.420
That's because she expects highly of you.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.540
On the contrary, look at me.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.460
She doesn't have any expectation of me.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.820
So no matter how big the mistake I make,

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.420
she doesn't take that too seriously.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.660
Chuchu, you're so smart.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.900
You must be aware of

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.100
such a simple fact.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.620
If what you said is true,

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.100
how can you explain

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.140
I left those miners unattended?

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.740
That's because

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.820
at that time you were Minister of Defense.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.180
You should certainly stick to
what you should do.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.020
If given another chance,

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.980
you'd surely choose to save people.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:13.860
Right?

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.660
You'd better prepare for the Crown Princess Election

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.300
in a steady and careful way.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.700
Zi Rui.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.260
Have a look at what I brought you.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.700
These are test questions predicted
by various famous teachers.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.380
Chuchu, you must not fall short of

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.900
my expectations of you.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.140
Qianqian, you are so...

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.140
It doesn't matter.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.340
If you have exercise books

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.620
that you have finished off,

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.340
you can give them to me and I'll...

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.300
Exercise books I've finished off?

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.620
I want to review them after I go back.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:50.900
Zi Zhu.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.460
Chuchu, I'm gonna go.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.300
Good luck!

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.620
The Third Princess is getting more
and more mature.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.340
Her words sound perfectly organized.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.100
Qianqian has been innocent since childhood.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.940
She was frank
and rarely deceived other people.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.300
Perhaps I am narrow-minded.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.100
Since childhood,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.780
mother has been strict about my homework.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.860
Especially when it comes to management,

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.420
she taught me all that she knew.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.660
I didn't get the overall view
of the situation,

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.900
didn't give it deep thinking

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.620
and took it out on Qianqian.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.180
Every time the Third Princess

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.180
took something from you,

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.340
she did it in a secret way.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.020
But you still trust her so much.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:43.860
Zi Zhu.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.740
Think about Young Master Han.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.660
Her Majesty had planned
to make him marry you.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.780
How could the Third Princess
shamelessly take him away by force?

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.420
I've been taking care of Qianqian
for more than ten years.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.460
No matter what had happened,

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.020
she didn't guard against me

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.140
and always thought about things for my sake.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.220
Otherwise,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.620
she wouldn't have given me
these exercise books today.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.460
The Third Princess took away the exercise books

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.900
you have finished off.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.540
Who knows what she is plotting.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.820
It doesn't matter.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.620
Your Highness.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.300
These exercise books have been used.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.340
What are you gonna do with them?

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.500
You don't understand.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.900
They are very useful.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:18.740
Listen up,

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.340
when you see Young Master later,

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.900
you tell him that these
are all written by me.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.820
Are you clear?

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:24.980
Yes.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.460
He's coming.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.580
Come on. Wake up.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.180
Why don't you have a rest, Your Highness.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.500
No. This question is too hard.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.140
Young Master.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.420
It's you.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.140
These questions are done.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.620
Can I have a rest now?

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.180
I've been thinking for so long.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.060
What's up?

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.940
The Crown Princess Election is around the corner.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.860
I come here to help you
with the discourse on politics.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.460
The discourse on politics?

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.060
Isn't that debating?

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:13.740
Don't worry.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.900
I have a talent for speaking.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.220
You are so confident.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.820
Why don't we have a bet?

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:20.860
On what?

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.380
If I win,

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.500
you kiss me.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.740
What if I win?

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.500
I kiss you.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.060
You are testing me on how well I can
deal with changing situation, aren't you?

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.020
This is no kidding.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.900
Let me ask you a question.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.580
In Huayuan city,

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.620
the relationship between father-in-law
and son-in-law is always hard to be settled.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.660
Not only can father-in-law beat
and scold his son-in-law at will,

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.340
but he can also make the decision
to divorce him.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.860
If one day

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.660
the father-in-law is arguing
with the son-in-law,

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.220
should the son-in-law make a compromise

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.540
or should he argue strongly
with the father-in-law?

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.460
I think he should argue strongly.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.060
Isn't it like the conflicts between
mother-in-law and daughter-in-law?

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.740
It's no big deal.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.260
Since you chose the negative side,

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.780
I choose the positive side.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.780
I think he should make a compromise.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.300
The conflict between
father-in-law and son-in-law

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.860
is nothing but some trivial matters.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.780
No matter how strongly
they argue with each other,

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.180
they won't get a result.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.820
And even if you do get
the upper hand in the conflict,

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.060
you won't get much benefit.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.540
Why can't they restrain themselves a little
for the sake of the family

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.860
and make peace with each other?

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.060
Actually the spouse is uncomfortable

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.100
being stuck in between.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.180
That is to say,

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:31.860
if one day

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.420
you have an argument with my mother,

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.860
you will make a compromise for me?

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.220
Don't worry.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.740
I won't let you be harmed.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.820
And my mother will surely love

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.300
the one I love.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.220
What are you talking about?

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.660
Well.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:51.900
This time,

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.580
you win.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.420
Zi Rui, I'm hungry. Let's go.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.380
He is weird.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.380
He is not weird.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.380
Young Master Han must have fallen in love with you.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:12.860
That makes sense.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.900
I'm his wife in name.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.020
He is afraid that Her Majesty may
use our relationship to give him a hard life.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.220
It doesn't matter.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.940
We'll have to split up
sooner or later anyway.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.180
What are you doing?

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.180
If you have something on your mind,
you can talk with me.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.660
But don't resort to violence.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.780
Young Master said

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.020
everyone in the mansion
can ask Your Highness questions.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.140
I'd like to ask you

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.620
whether a man who acts cute
will live a good life.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.820
Actually.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.220
Both men and women act cute sometimes.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.220
It's no big deal.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.020
It's like a lubricant.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.620
Let's say there is a conflict
between a man and a woman.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.980
If you act cute and make a compromise,

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.380
showing respect for the other side

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.260
and gaining benefit from her,

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.100
you'll find that the conflict is eased

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.380
or has disappeared.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.380
So acting cute is good

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.500
for both sides.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.140
A man who acts cute will live a good life.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.500
I cannot lift it up.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.580
Is there a young lady who can help me?

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.980
I'm not a young lady.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.860
Once again?

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.860
Sorry to bother you,

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.380
but I'm wondering

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.860
could men be allowed to take the test

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.340
and get an official position of some kind.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.420
Yes.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.180
When it comes to job,

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.940
there should not be sex discrimination.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.380
Why can't a man be an official?

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.540
Time to have dinner.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.820
Young Master Han said

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.780
only after you answer the question
seriously can you begin to eat.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.100
I just want to have some food.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.460
But now I have to get into an argument.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.780
Is it reasonable?

00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.340
Well.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.060
I'm not gonna eat.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.740
I'm not gonna eat. Is that okay?

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.780
Young Master has good intentions.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.660
But you...

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.340
Good intentions?

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.100
If he had good intentions,
he wouldn't have been hard on me like this.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.540
I'm telling you,

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.300
I don't want to take the test.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.460
I don't want to be the Crown Princess.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:15.980
From now on,

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.220
no one is allowed to talk to me.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.740
Leave me alone.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.420
But this.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.220
Take it.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.500
The chicken made no mistake.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.300
Even the rooster is at odds
with me, isn't it?

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.420
(Risheng Mansion)

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.580
Your Highness.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.980
It's said that many people are betting
on the Crown Princess Election.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.900
The Third Princess went so far as to

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.260
bet all her money on the Second Princess.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.460
I fully understand what she is thinking.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.260
She used to be arrogant
by virtue of her Kung Fu.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.380
But now she cannot practice Kung Fu anymore.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.500
The disappointment

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.340
can only be understood by the person
with the same experience.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.420
I'm gonna visit her.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.140
Forget about it.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.020
It's windy outside.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.860
If by any chance I catch cold

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.540
and have a cough with lungs infected

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.180
or even go into a coma
and cannot take medicine,

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.780
I'm gonna die.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.380
Your Highness, you're making an excuse.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.340
Well, it's important to visit Qianqian.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.060
There won't be any trouble
if I wear more clothes.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.180
Young Master,

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.140
I have something to tell you

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.740
and I don't want to wait any longer.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:20.620
Just say it.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.660
Look at me.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.220
I

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.460
don't want to win the literacy test

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.820
or the Kung Fu test

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.780
or the discourse on politics.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.420
I don't want to get involved in any fight
related to Crown Princess.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.780
Although I was not good
at literary writing before,

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.940
I excelled in Kung Fu.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:35.900
But now

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.340
I'm good at nothing.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.580
I'm nobody.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.620
But you

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.940
were forcing me again and again

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.620
to fight against others.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.860
Do you think it is reasonable?

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.140
Qianqian, if you don't have a try,

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.500
how do you know you won't make it?

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.300
What's more, I'm here.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.220
I'll come up with a foolproof plan

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.380
to let you win.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:56.980
Look at this.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.780
I wrote down the answers.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.020
All you have to do
is to bear them in your mind.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.900
Even if I win the literacy test,

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.420
what can it bring me?

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.380
Can it bring me less humiliation?

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.740
Or can it bring me less ridicule?

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:12.980
No, it can't.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.340
No matter how hard I try

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.860
and how much effort I make,

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.820
I'm still a worthless person,

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.180
a fat worthless person who
is ridiculed by the whole world.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.860
I see.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.260
Your Highness, don't take it personally.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.980
The Third Princess

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.460
was talking about herself.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.820
Let's go.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.660
But what she said makes sense.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.700
How does a worthless person

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.860
have the nerve to run
for the Crown Princess Election?

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.980
Even if I win the literacy test
and the discourse on politics,

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.980
will that change the latter half of my life?

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.020
Am I able to stand up again?

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.300
Your Highness.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.300
Mr. Su.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.380
Zi Nian.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.860
Minister Pei asked me to

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.500
ask why Her Highness

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.940
was absent from class
for no reason these days.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.700
Her Highness is in no mood to study.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.860
Why?

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.340
It's all because of the Third Princess.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.300
Not only did she give herself up,

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.420
but she had set a bad example
and make Her Highness follow suit.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.860
Would you please deliver
a message to Her Highness?

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:00.940
Tell Her Highness that

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.220
I came here to visit her.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.260
Your Highness.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.900
Your Highness. The garden overflows
with the beauty of spring.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.380
Let me

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.260
accompany Your Highness to have a walk.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.420
Don't bother.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.860
No matter how beautiful it is,

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.700
it will decline sometime.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.260
I don't want the bleak sight in the future

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.980
remind me of today's beauty,

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.900
thus making me feel sad.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.860
Your Highness.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.060
You are kind-hearted.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.900
You should see

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.500
the pleasant things in the world.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.780
As seasons alternate,

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.380
even the bleakest flowers

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.660
will bloom again one day.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:02.860
Right?

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.980
How did Yuanyuan overhear the words

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.500
that I spoke to Han Shuo?

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.340
Why?

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:16.940
Your Highness.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.060
You're straightforward and open-minded.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.420
But Her Highness is intelligent.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.300
I'm afraid she takes things too seriously

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.380
and gets herself into a dead end.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.100
I see.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.940
You want me to comfort her.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.140
I'd appreciate it very much.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.420
Su Mu, why do you thank me
on behalf of Yuanyuan?

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.820
Her Highness once said that

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.980
it doesn't matter where a hero comes from.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.020
Although I am working at clan school now,

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.220
but everyone who knows me

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.660
regards me as a musician

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.220
from the Music and Dance Academy.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.740
Only Her Highness

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.780
regards me as an ordinary person.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.100
That's right.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.460
You and Yuanyuan are
indeed linked by ties of fate.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.660
That's not the case.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.020
It's just that Her Highness and
Your Highness felt compassion for me

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.060
and had a good opinion of me.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.780
Okay, I'll go and explain to Yuanyuan.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.740
Things are not as she heard them.

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:15.940
I appreciate it very much. Your Highness.

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.220
(The 20th draft of Will)

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.900
Yuanyuan. Yuanyuan.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.100
Your Highness.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.460
Didn't I tell you to stop her?

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.580
If I want to come in, who dares to stop me?

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.500
(I'm a worthless person to Huayuan City...)

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.060
Yuanyuan. What are you doing?

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.140
You don't want to take the test?

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:50.940
As a worthless person,

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.220
I will only be ridiculed
by the whole world no matter what.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.220
Isn't that what you said?

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.100
No, Yuanyuan.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.300
I was talking about myself.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.060
It was none of your business.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.780
Don't take it personally.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.820
It's my business to decide
whether to take the test or not.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.300
You have no right to decide it for me.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.940
Your Highness, what are you doing?

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.060
Chen Qianqian.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.860
Are you humiliating me?

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.020
No. That's not the case.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.420
Yuanyuan, I'm caring about you.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.500
I don't want to see you
give yourself up like this.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.860
Caring about me?

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.500
I'm really caring about you.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:30.700
I've made some preparation.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.780
I'm not kidding.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.500
Look.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.060
This is what I've sorted out
from a lot of books.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.940
I've done it for some days.

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.460
I've been planning

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.700
to give it to you when I get the chance.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.420
I don't know if it is useful.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.740
But perhaps these can help you

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.660
to stand up again.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.620
No matter how they work,

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.740
you should try them.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.660
You found these cures for me.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:52.740
Do you think that

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.940
your medical skill is better than mine?

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.420
Your medical skill is absolutely good.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.700
But for so many years

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.660
you haven't given medical care to your legs.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.380
Your Highness, please stop.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.980
Because you don't dare to, do you?

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.500
Because you are afraid
that you cannot cure your legs.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.700
So over the years,

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.580
you haven't tried

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.180
to let yourself stand up again.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.140
(Rehabilitation Guideline)

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.820
You want to make me stand up again.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.660
It's just like you want to win the Kung Fu test
though you are unable to practice Kung Fu.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.420
Do you think it is possible?

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.220
You get out of here.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:22.860
Yuanyuan.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.100
Your Highness, please go back.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.700
(Your humble daughter Chen Yuanyuan bows to Your Majesty)

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.540
(Rehabilitation Guideline)

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.820
Stop drinking.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.100
Zi Rui, why can't this wine make me drunk?

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.100
It's full of fruit juice inside.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.380
It's impossible to get drunk.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:01.300
What's more,

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.580
Young Master Han told me not to let you drink wine.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.620
Drinking wine is harmful to health.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.700
Why does Han Shuo want to
dominate my life in every aspect?

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.660
Eh...

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.980
Excuse me, Miss,

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.300
what are you worrying about?

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.540
What are you gonna do by doing this?

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.940
I'm not a kid.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.740
It's my apology.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.540
Qianqian.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.660
Since you don't want to prepare for the test,

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.340
I won't push you anymore.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.140
That's good.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.860
What?

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.580
Don't you feel this doll

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.700
is much like you?

00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.900
Yeah. It looks like me.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.460
What about this one?

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.460
Who does it look like?

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.020
This...

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.780
Sorry, I broke it.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.220
It doesn't matter.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.020
It'd be okay if I put its legs back.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.380
Legs cannot be put back again.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.500
It's all my fault.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:38.660
It's just a doll.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.500
Why are you so sad?

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.460
Did it ever occur to you that

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.140
for the common people,

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.820
we are at a dominating position
which can never be reached.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.900
Even a casual sentence

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.900
can easily change someone's fate.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.460
They are

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.140
just like this clay figurine.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.380
Something I've done before

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.820
easily changed someone else's fate.

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.700
But I've never asked

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.180
that person's idea and feeling.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.980
Ever since I was diagnosed
with heart disease,

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.100
I've visited famous doctors across the world.

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.540
They all said that I would die before 20.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.140
I had thought that

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.940
I would die like this in a foreign land.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.900
But it never occurred to me that

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.140
you appeared.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.740
It was you who got the Dragon Bone for me

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.340
and cured my heart disease.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.300
Until then I came to realize that

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.300
no one's fate is predestined.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.300
Perhaps all of it can be changed.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.700
Just like me.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.740
(Rehabilitation Guideline)
You want to make me stand up again.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.460
It's just like you want to win the Kung Fu test
though you are unable to practice Kung Fu.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.300
Do you think it is possible?

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.140
Do you think that

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.660
I can win the Kung Fu test

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.540
though I'm unable to practice Kung Fu?

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.740
Miss Lin Qi, you invited me out,

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:32.820
what do you want from me?

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.980
If Miss Lin Qi want me to do something,

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.340
you can just tell me.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.020
There's no need to present
such a generous gift.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.180
I feel...

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.060
very embarrassed.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.260
Listen to me.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.740
I want you to

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.860
make Chen Qianqian fight
against me at the Kung Fu test

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.100
no matter what the agenda is.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.660
The Third Princess?

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.580
But...

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.220
It is just the deposit.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:07.940
You'll absolutely

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.860
get the rest.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.180
I will go all out to do

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.300
what you tell me to do.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.020
I'm gonna fix her myself

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.340
and bring disgrace on her publicly.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.420
I have good news and bad news.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.740
Which do you want to hear first?

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.540
Bad news first.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.420
Let me hear what news could be worse.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.060
It's said that Lin Qi bought off
the Kung Fu test officer.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.980
She wanted to fight against you herself.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.620
Since I've got myself into this situation,

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.500
I don't think there's any good news.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.860
The good news is

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.220
I can let you win.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.020
Your Highness, Your Highness.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.340
My master doesn't want
to meet any guest today.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.380
I just want to say two sentences.
Just two sentences.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:19.700
Yuanyuan.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.060
Your Highness, please go back.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:21.780
Her Highness said that

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.940
she doesn't want to see you recently.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:23.620
Yuanyuan.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.340
I come here today just to ask you

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.700
if I win

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.180
the Kung Fu test at the Crown Princess Election,

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.940
can you promise me
to do rehabilitation training

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.980
and make efforts to stand up again?

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.060
Your Highness, please
don't make things difficult for me.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.180
Her Highness won't see you today.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.060
Yuanyuan.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.380
Yuanyuan, if you don't say a word.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.540
I take it as your acquiescence.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.580
I'm telling you,

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.020
I'll surely win the Kung Fu test.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.140
At that time you should not
act shamelessly and deny it.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.940
Who on earth is acting shamelessly?

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.620
Yuanyuan.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.580
However hard it is, I will make it.
