=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 3)

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.260
What... what did you say?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.660
I mean

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.620
that I didn't intend

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.700
to humiliate Han Shuo today.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.180
You compared him with a musician
at the Music and Dance Academy.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.580
You don't think that's humiliation?

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.460
I'm sorry.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.780
You're... sorry?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.340
I know.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.380
I made a mistake.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.220
You... You are really apologizing?

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.340
I understand how Han Shuo feels.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.300
You had a sleep

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.420
and found that everything had changed.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.460
You looked around

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.420
and there wasn't a single person you know.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.500
You have to exhaust yourself

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.420
handling people around you every day.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.860
You can't have a proper meal

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.460
and you're afraid other people will harm you.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.340
You also fear that you'll mess it up

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.780
and then you can't go home.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.340
Perhaps you'll even be beheaded

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.780
or shot to death.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.780
I've got it.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.540
I'll go and apologize to Han Shuo now.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.340
Pei Heng,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.860
I know you hated me before.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.100
But I'm different now.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.260
Don't be disappointed in me, will you?

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.940
Okay.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.580
Mr. Pei,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.100
you said you'd break off your engagement

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.140
and Her Highness was so nervous and sad.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.180
It's really new to me.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.420
When has she ever

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.100
yielded over the years?

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.500
She's willing

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.140
to apologize to Young Master Han for you.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.780
It seems

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.980
she cares very much about you.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.380
Don't request Her Majesty

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.380
to cancel your engagement.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.460
(Accumulate achievements
to influence the descendants)

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.460
Ready.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.300
To its full extent.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.260
Come on, Xiaoqian.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.900
Han Shuo is not the same as another one.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.020
I can get along with him.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.060
You can do it.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.620
Wait.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.340
What is it you came for at this late hour?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.980
Do you think

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.860
you haven't humiliated me enough?

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.980
Han Shuo.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.460
Young Master Han,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.180
I did the wrong thing today.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.780
I was reckless and inconsiderate.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.660
You're a forgiving person.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.180
Don't take it to heart.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.700
Are you apologizing?

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.180
Do you think I'll believe you?

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.700
If you don't believe me,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.180
there's only one thing I can do.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.300
You were almost stripped in public today.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.500
I'll make amends to you.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.580
You...

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.060
Even if people in Huayuan City
always do what they want,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.020
few are as brazen as you.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.740
After I did this,

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.500
we're even, aren't we?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.820
How...

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.380
how can they be the same?

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.180
Oh, yes.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.100
You were also watched by a crowd today.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.180
Okay,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.140
I'll go and walk around the street.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.460
Stop.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.540
Ready.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.860
Nominally you're my wife.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.740
You can't dress like this in the street.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.540
Don't look at me.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.020
What do you think I should do, then?

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.260
I...

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.540
I'll take one more piece of clothes off?

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.260
What are you doing?

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.260
Does Young Master Han want to do it himself?

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.340
You rascal!

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.180
-I... -You rascal.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.300
I didn't do anything.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.940
What were you yelling for?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.980
You yourself is the rascal.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.940
What shall we do?

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.860
You crazy woman,

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.140
you picked me up

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.340
when we first met in the street.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.700
You wanted to see beauties

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.540
and took me to a brothel.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.420
When you saw Pei Heng,
you were giddy with happiness

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.980
and got entangled with him.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.220
The baby you're carrying

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.420
is his, isn't it?

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.300
You've violated the Seven Regulations

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.180
and ethics for women. You're dissipated

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.180
by nature and... and... and...

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.780
How come you still have your gecko cinnabar?

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.660
So you're a complicated man, aren't you?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.820
Cold, unfeeling, shy and bewildered

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.500
can all be used to describe you, right?

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.140
I have my gecko cinnabar.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.420
What's wrong with that?

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.380
Don't be fussy.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:07.940
But...

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.460
You... you are not pregnant?

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.260
I had to tell mother I was pregnant

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.580
to save you.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.860
You disregarded your honor

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.980
to save me?

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.420
Compared with someone's life,

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.820
my honor is not important.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.300
I really wanted to save you.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.460
Besides,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.620
how much is my honor worth?

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.100
That's right.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.140
If the rumors are true,

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.300
you can certainly

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.420
discard your reputation.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.820
Han Shuo,

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.300
let's make an agreement.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.420
In public,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.460
we'll obey rules of Huayuan City

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.500
and you'll listen to me.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.340
In private,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.220
we'll obey rules of Xuanhu City

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.820
and I'll listen to you.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.140
You show me some respect

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.460
and I'll show you more.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.620
This is our way to be

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.100
a nominal couple.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.860
That's settled.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.020
Don't go back on it.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.860
Stop.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.700
What now?

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.020
Put on your clothes first.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.340
It's no big deal.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.740
She's outside. What do we do?

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.300
Ready. To its full extent.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.540
Oh, no.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.460
It's late and cold.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.140
Okay.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.420
Thank you.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:07.740
Zi Zhu!

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.660
Zi Zhu!

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:11.580
Zi Zhu.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.100
Zi Zhu.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.580
Your Highness, I've done my best.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.820
Zi Zhu!

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.500
Chuchu,

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.700
I've waited for this day

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.700
since the moment I entered Huayuan City.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.420
You and I were destined to fight.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.860
Accept defeat.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.060
Han Shuo,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.740
I had never suspected you,

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.660
yet you treated me so cruelly.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.100
Today is the Double Seventh Festival.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.380
You injured my mother seriously

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.780
when she was strolling in the street,

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.100
lit the beacon

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.820
and attacked our city.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.820
And Lin Qi.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.140
How many people around me have you killed?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.500
That's not all.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.780
I've also killed your sister,
Chen Qianqian who you always love,

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.220
with a cup of poisoned wine

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.220
on the wedding night.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.460
Qianqian was also killed by you?

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.740
Han Shuo is really ruthless.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.060
Though I've survived

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.940
from his poisoned wine and arrows,

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.740
I have to hang on till the ending

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.980
so that I can go home.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.980
I can't die.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.380
I mustn't die.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.780
Do you get me?

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.980
Now I don't want to know

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.540
how the apple and the banana can be together.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.020
I just want to know

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.340
how the orange can save herself

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.100
when the banana is bent on killing her.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.020
You're all outstanding members

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.340
of the storytellers.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.580
Help me think of a way

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.300
to make up the story

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.220
so that the orange will be saved.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.020
Does the orange have a bad reputation?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.260
She has done many evil deeds

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.340
and she's notorious.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.380
Did the orange offend the banana?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.020
She first took him for marriage,

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.100
then put him in prison

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.380
and humiliated him in public.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.620
The banana is merciless and vengeful.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.780
He's a deep man

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.180
and never hesitates to kill.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.220
Now he's licking his wounds

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.500
and waiting for a window of opportunity.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.420
When he recovers

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.100
and builds up his strength,

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.180
he... he'll be like a tiger
dashing down the mountain

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.580
and a king fighting a war.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.660
He'll simply

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.900
do everything he wants.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.940
No one can stop him except the apple.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.300
In that case,

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.220
why don't you just...

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.060
You can't write anything
without killing someone, can you?

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.500
The banana will live.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.980
He'll be useful in the future.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.060
Change his mind with love, then.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.340
Talk some sense into him

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.900
so that he'll repent and find a way out.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.380
I don't know how to do that.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.180
You need some events to change

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.580
people's opinion of a character, don't you?

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.100
The lines alone aren't enough.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.540
There's nothing I can suggest, then.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.220
The orange's death

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.700
is inevitable and everyone expects it.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.540
Yes.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.420
Your Highness,

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.180
why are you so bent on saving the orange?

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.980
Because Party A demands it.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.460
She invests in the drama

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.020
and wants to live a few more days, okay?

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.900
What... what's Party A?

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.580
Me.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:24.900
I'm Party A.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:25.900
I order you

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.420
to think of a way

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.620
to save this orange now.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:29.820
Understood?

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.500
Party A is quite willful.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.020
She's rich.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:36.900
Your Highness,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.300
the orange

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.860
has to have some advantage, hasn't she?

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:42.860
She's rich,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.620
powerful

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.580
and maybe a little pretty.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:49.860
Those intrinsic ones.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.140
Smart, resourceful and quick-witted.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.340
What about her skills?

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.980
She knows what will happen. Does it count?

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.580
The orange knows the whole story

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.940
like the back of her hand.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.020
She knows how the banana will kill her,

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.620
lure the apple,

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.340
scheme and order his men

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.500
to stir up trouble in secret

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.820
and get the thing to continue to live

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.140
from the apple.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.340
She knows all these things.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.860
Your Highness,

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.660
why didn't you say that earlier?

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.900
Think about it.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.060
Now that the orange is good at divination,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:28.980
she definitely knows

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.700
how she can avoid danger

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.300
and change it into her advantage.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.540
Be more specific.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.540
Use anything that betrays the banana,

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.820
save him, help him, protect him,

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.460
earn his trust,

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.100
change his impression of you

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.540
and lower his guard.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.820
Won't I be currying favor with him?

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.100
You have to do that when you should.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.420
Right.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.100
How about this,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.540
gentlemen?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.180
Suppose

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.060
when the banana is seeing a spy,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.420
the apple comes to encircle them

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.420
and the orange turns up in front

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.740
of the banana and rescues him,

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.580
do you think

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.180
the orange

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.660
can earn the banana's trust?

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.820
Guys,

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.340
was there such a story before?

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.580
There was

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.740
if I want it.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:29.940
Young Master.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.780
Our spy has got
the defense map of Huayuan City

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.340
and wants to meet us at half past eleven

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.740
on the moat tonight.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.380
Defense map?

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.620
(Defense Map of Huayuan City)

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.260
Your Highness, I've received a tip-off.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.500
Someone will meet a spy of Xuanhu City

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.180
at half past eleven tonight on the moat.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.340
Who sent it?

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.100
I have no idea.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.060
Your Highness, Her Majesty
is wary of Xuanhu City.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.140
If you can catch its spy,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.740
she'll definitely regard you with favor.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.220
As for the tip-off,

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.660
it's better

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.860
to believe it.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.420
Qianqian has just married Han Shuo.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.980
If the spy of Xuanhu City is exposed now...

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.860
You can't always think of the Third Princess.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.300
Your Highness, Her Majesty
let you take charge

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.740
of the army without thinking about it.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.460
She has great expectations of you.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.220
He's here. He's here.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.060
The fish has bitten.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.380
Listen,

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.900
we'll do it

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.100
when Chuchu is going

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.220
to catch Han Shuo.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.100
I'll say

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.300
I'm the person who's meeting Han Shuo here

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.100
and there isn't a spy of Xuanhu City.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.580
And then

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.940
I'll get Han Shuo out of trouble

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.060
and he'll think I'm on his side.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.340
What a brilliant idea.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.420
You're framing Young Master Han again.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.300
If Her Majesty knows, she'll punish you.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.620
My mother is fond of me.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.740
She won't do that.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.380
Han Shuo is sick.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.500
He suffers from paranoia.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.380
I've got to cure him.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.660
The time has come. Let's go.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.060
Why is no one here?

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.780
Did they know we'd come?

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.740
Your Highness, someone's here.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:07.900
On alert.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:14.900
I'm here!

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.740
Qianqian, why is it you?

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.460
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.940
You're going to meet someone here?

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.700
Yes.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:28.740
Where's he?

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.180
He...

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.460
he...

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.060
he...

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.740
he didn't... he didn't come.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.900
Where's Han Shuo?

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.020
Did you arrange to meet him?

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.900
Your Highness,

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.940
think it over before you tell us

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.380
who you're going to meet here.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.740
I'm going to meet...

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.100
No.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.380
Chuchu, did you get something wrong?

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.860
So you are the person who's going

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.660
to meet a spy of Xuanhu City.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.660
Colluding with the enemy
is a capital offense.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.900
Collude with the enemy? Me?

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:06.740
Is that possible?

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.980
Don't talk nonsense.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.700
Han Shuo wasn't tricked
but tricked me instead.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.740
This is an important matter

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.700
and I can't decide.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.060
But I'll intercede with mother for you.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.820
Yes. Her Majesty loves you.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.540
Even if you collude with the enemy,

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.260
you'll be demoted to a commoner at worst.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.620
Oh, come to think of it,

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.420
I came because I received a tip-off

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.580
and it said someone was going

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.500
to meet a spy of Xuanhu City here.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.420
I came to catch them.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.820
With Zi Rui?

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.940
You are really eloquent,

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.220
Your Highness.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.180
You said I colluded with the enemy.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.380
Do you have any evidence?

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.780
Chuchu, let me tell you the truth.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.900
Actually I'm here to admire the moon.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.860
Tonight

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.700
the moon is full, so I came.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.780
And I happened to meet you here.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.900
I'm sleepy.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.140
Zi Rui, let's go back.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.220
Yes.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.540
Your Highness,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.500
you just let her go?

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.780
Her Majesty dotes on her and neglects you.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.220
It was such a good chance.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.460
Qianqian seems to be

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.540
afraid of nothing

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.860
but actually she's the most cowardly.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.180
She doesn't dare to collude with the enemy.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:22.940
I guess

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.620
if there's really such a spy of Xuanhu City,

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.340
it must be related to Han Shuo.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.900
Perhaps

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.460
Qianqian was used by him.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.260
I'll have something on
Han Shuo sooner or later.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.100
This way.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:35.900
Quick.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.540
This is suspicious.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.860
What shall we do?

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.500
We'll make use of this trap

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.580
and find the person behind it.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.620
I told you he suffered from paranoia.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.820
It's okay.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.660
Watch how I turn the tables.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.700
Have you heard of this, Han Shuo?

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.820
Without faith, a man can't establish himself,

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.340
a business can't prosper

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.780
and a country will wane.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.460
Shouldn't we keep faith with other people?

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.660
You were invited to go there.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.660
Why did you incriminate other people?

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.420
Are you talking about the moat?

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.460
You could just ignore it

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.700
but you went there and tricked me

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.820
into going on the boat. I was almost wronged.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.140
It isn't right.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.140
You're quite honest.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.380
Let me ask you.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.580
I was almost tricked tonight.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.060
Was it your doing?

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.660
I tricked you?

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.900
Do you know how much I worried about you?

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.820
I heard

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.660
Chuchu was going to catch
a spy of Xuanhu City

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.020
and I specially went to help you out.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.700
I had no idea you'd put me in that situation.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.140
How could you be so sure

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.860
I was the person the Second Princess
was going to catch?

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.060
How come I was sure?

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.540
I was afraid.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.140
I should go there

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.060
in case it was you, shouldn't I?

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:45.980
That's to say,

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.500
you weren't trying to frame me

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.460
but to save me?

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.500
Han Shuo,

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.380
I've really taken pains to help you.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.420
Is that so?

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.180
Don't move.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.660
You're hurt.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.380
Yes,

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.060
I am hurt.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.700
I am hurt in order to save you.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.180
Why on earth did you try to save me?

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.100
Because I'm on your side.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.460
Can you be

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.140
on my side, too?

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.100
Tell me if you have any problems.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.700
I will go all out

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.700
to solve them for you

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:47.900
and be of service to you.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.300
Why are you willing to do
so many things for me?

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.380
Because...

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.980
because I want you to be happy.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.900
You want me

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.420
to be happy?

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:09.740
It's useless talking so much.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.380
I'll prove it with my actions

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.740
that I'm good and I'm not clingy.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.940
You'll be satisfied.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.300
It'll be a shame if I die.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.180
Well,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.340
it's a good thing you didn't go there.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.220
Chuchu was so horrible.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.460
I've got to have a late-night snack

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.620
and ginseng soup to steady my nerves.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.300
Have a good rest.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.020
Young Master,

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.700
do you think we can believe the Third Princess?

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.380
Yes.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.900
But how come I always feel

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.740
it was her trickery?

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.300
Think about this.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.220
She's always moody,

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.580
unpredictable and dishonest.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.620
That's because she's an innocent girl.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.580
This matter is related to the defense map

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.540
and a sealing wax bamboo tube
that we use to communicate.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.740
The person who could get these two things

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.220
would never be Chen Qianqian, an idiot.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.980
The Second Princess, Chen Chuchu,

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.860
is a prudent person.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.940
It was most likely her doing.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.900
The Second Princess harmed us

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.020
because the two cities detest each other

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.220
and she wanted to distinguish herself.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.780
But why did the Third Princess save us?

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.860
Does she want something in return?

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.020
That should be true.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.500
Does she know our city is powerful

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.220
and we can take Huayuan City any time?

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.700
Does she know our city is populous

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.860
and awash with money?

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.300
She doesn't want our forces

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.220
or money.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.340
What does she want?

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.820
Me.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.380
This woman

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.380
adores me.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.100
She fell in love with you?

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.460
That day her horse was panicked.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.180
I lent her a hand

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.900
and she was attracted to me

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.340
and took me for marriage.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.740
But she put you in prison
on your wedding night.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.580
She was trying to save me.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.860
She even professed that she was pregnant.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.140
She also humiliated you in public.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.100
She regretted it right away

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.700
and apologized to me. She even...

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.300
made amends to me.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.140
Young Master,

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.740
even if the Third Princess has feelings for you,

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.140
she's useless.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.220
She has no abilities or morals

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.460
and she's infamous.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.860
Will she be of help to us?

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.660
I can use her to get the Dragon Bone.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.540
How about the Second Princess?

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.740
Weren't you going to use her?

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.620
You said she was the most
excellent princess of Huayuan City

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.300
and she'd hopefully be the City Owner.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.700
Also, if you married her,
you'd get the Dragon Bone

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.620
and the black stone mine,

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.580
right?

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.220
I was wrong.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.260
Now the Third Princess,

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.940
Chen Qianqian, should be the one

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.780
who the owner of Huayuan City favors.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.060
She's also kind of clever.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.460
If I give advice behind her,

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.740
she can definitely do great things.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.060
Young Master.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.060
You've seen it.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.740
The Second Princess cold-shouldered me

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.180
and even plotted against me.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.180
The Third Princess, Chen Qianqian,

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.460
has protected me a hundred times.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.900
Why should we ignore Chen Qianqian

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.540
and take the trouble

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.460
to approach the Second Princess?

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.420
That's

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:07.620
reasonable.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.500
Young Master,

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.380
brilliant.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.620
So all along no one showed up

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.900
and you didn't find anything, right?

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.940
I'm incompetent.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:28.980
Of course you are.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.220
You've alerted the enemy.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.340
Now it's even harder for us

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.780
to have something on them.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.820
I was being negligent. I'm sorry.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.980
Does this matter

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.300
really have nothing to do with Han Shuo?

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.900
It indeed has nothing to do with him.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:45.580
I don't know

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.180
who gave us the information.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.620
You were

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.180
too eager for honors

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.620
to lack the judgment.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.420
Xuanhu City married a patient

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.620
to Huayuan City.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.460
There must be a follow-up to it.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.500
Yes.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.900
Don't be angry, mother.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.220
She's so careless.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.140
How can I let her

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.460
be the City Owner?

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.900
Your Majesty,

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.540
the Second Princess

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.900
has been doing well.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.340
Give her more time and chances.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.620
I believe the Second Princess

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.740
won't let you down.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.700
And Qianqian.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.780
She's disobedient and capable of nothing.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.500
I've really given up on her.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.220
The Second and the Third Princesses are on good terms

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.100
and they're like real sisters.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.860
When the Second Princess succeeds you,

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.780
I believe

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.700
she will take care of the Third Princess

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.820
and let her be free
and well off all her life.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.780
I hope so.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.540
My youngest daughter is incompetent

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.500
and the eldest one is always sick.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.060
My successor

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.820
shall be Chuchu.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.060
(An aura of orchid's elegance)

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.620
Your Highness.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.740
Tomorrow Qianqian will go back

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:57.900
to clan school after her leave.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.540
I hear Young Master Han
will enter the school, too.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.700
Help me ask Minister Pei for leave.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.140
Don't, Your Highness.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.060
You can't be absent from school

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.140
to avoid the Third Princess.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.380
In my opinion,

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.940
you should see and talk to people

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.820
and relax a bit.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.620
You'll get worse if you're always alone.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.580
How worse can it be?

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.500
My mother has forgotten about me

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.060
and my sisters never think of me

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.180
as their elder sister.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.300
Perhaps

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.180
The Third Princess will be mature
after she got married

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.220
and stop causing you trouble.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.940
Can marriage change a person?

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.900
Han Shuo has done a good job, then.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.140
When you meet someone you fancy,

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.260
you'll also be different.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.540
I'm afraid I'll die before that.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.820
(The Tenth Draft of Will)

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.820
Put my new will away.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.700
(The Tenth Draft of Will)

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.500
Why am I losing hair?

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.220
Zi Nian, close the door. Quickly.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.620
Don't let the wind in.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.940
And fetch me the barley, black sesame seeds,

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.140
black beans, Euryale seeds, lotus stamen

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.420
and walnuts that I prepared.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.300
Yes, Your Highness.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.980
What kind of fate I'm suffering?

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.340
I have to study and take exams
even in my dream.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.700
I gotta wake up quickly.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.900
Luckily Han Shuo won't think
about killing me now.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.860
Does that mean

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.740
I can pair him off with Chuchu?

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.740
What are you doing?

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.340
I'm a little deaf.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.060
I need to sit closer.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.500
Don't think I don't know.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.180
You just want to be close to Minister Pei.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.660
You've married Han Shuo.

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.620
Mind what you say and see.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.420
You're married.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.980
You'd better stay away from other men.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.300
No, no, no.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.020
I just want to have a class.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.060
Forget it. This stupid man
can't see the light.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.220
There's nothing I can do.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.460
According to rules of Huayuan City,

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.940
in the future, the princesses

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.740
will all need to take the Crown Princess Election

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.700
which consists of a literacy test

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.780
and discourse on politics.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.260
The one who does best in it

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.780
will be invested as the Crown Princess

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.260
by Her Majesty.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.740
Daughters of officials
will hold different positions

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.980
according to your performances.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.060
You're all assets to our city

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.700
and have a heavy schedule.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.220
Today we'll play a game.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.940
I will come first in archery.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.220
The game is not about the Five Arts.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.780
The Six Arts

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.940
are rites, music, archery, chariot racing,
calligraphy and mathematics.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.180
What are the Five Arts?

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.980
Performing music

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.740
is just a method of pleasing women.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.900
How can it be bracketed with the others?

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.820
We won't talk about classics
or history today.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.020
We'll compose verses.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.260
The titles are "Wind", "Flowers",
"Snow" and "Moon".

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.620
Choose one of them

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.540
and say two lines.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.380
They don't have to be
of seven or five characters,

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.300
or form a metrical poem or a quatrain.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.140
What matters is the rhyme.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.380
Let's start

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.100
from the Second Princess.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.340
I'll choose wind.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.140
Wind.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.140
The water is blown and rippled.

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.660
Trees on the mountains are steady.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.100
Your Highness, you've mastered it

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.500
and you can think big.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.700
Princess Royal, it's your turn.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.340
Flowers.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.500
Can not be red forever.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.180
Always vanish like a flash.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.940
Princess Royal,

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.980
you win some and you lose some.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.940
Don't be too pessimistic.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.500
Miss Lin Qi, please.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.180
Snow.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.020
Snow.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.540
I don't know what to say about snow.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.820
Chen Qianqian,

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.700
what are you laughing for?

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.940
Can you do it?

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.340
I'm no better than you.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.180
Of course I can't do it either.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.460
Why did you laugh, then?

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.500
I hear the Third Princess

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.820
has made progress recently.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.780
Why don't you give it a try?

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.540
Minister Pei,

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.540
don't stump her.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:48.980
Everyone knows

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.820
she can read few words.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.780
How about this?

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:53.140
We'll take a bet.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.900
If you can do it,

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.380
I'll

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.860
clean the toilet.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.180
If you can't,

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.620
you will clean the toilet.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.780
Are you so sure

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.020
that I can't do it?

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.180
Just say if you dare or not.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:15.940
I dare not.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:17.780
I'm too lazy.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.100
I bet the Third Princess will win.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.300
If you lose,

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.380
I'll clean the toilet for you.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.340
Must you do this?

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.660
You involved yourself

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.300
to see me lose face.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.900
It's just composing a verse.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.260
I wrote all your lines.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.980
It's a piece of cake for me.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.660
But Chen Qianqian is an illiterate person

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.780
who can't compose verses.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.700
That's hard.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.780
If Han Shuo cleans the toilet for me,

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.660
that will be hell.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.500
Why? Are you afraid?

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.900
That's nonsense.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.140
I got it.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.740
Wind.

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:03.980
Ham,

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.020
salted fish,

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.260
sausage.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.780
Suckling pigs,

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:12.940
baked pancakes,

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.940
whole lamb.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:19.940
Good.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.020
Why is it good?

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.340
Ham, salted fish and sausage

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.420
are all air-dried.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.180
Roast suckling pigs, baked pancakes
and roast whole lamb

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.100
all need to be made with bellows.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.300
I...

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.340
I'll have to clean the toilet, then?

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.300
I don't accept it.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.220
What?

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.700
Okay, I'll make you accept it today.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.860
Flowers.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.820
Cakes, desserts, red ginger.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.260
Scented tea, good and mellow wine.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.580
Good.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.260
Are they still about flowers?

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.580
Cakes, desserts and red ginger cakes

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.140
are usually made in the shape of flowers.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.700
I don't need to explain flower teas

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.620
and wines, do I?

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.140
There's food and drink.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.300
It's more interesting

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.620
than the former one about wind.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.980
These verses are wretched.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.060
Compose ones on

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.860
snow and the moon if you can.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.500
Snow.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.140
Blancmange, cold platter and cool cake

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.540
can be made when it snows.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.140
Jujube paste, five nuts and egg yolks

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.620
can be eaten when the moon is full.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.660
Lin Qi,

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.340
clean the toilet, please.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.580
Thank you.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.180
Minister Pei.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.540
Looks like

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.820
you've really made

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.380
progress in your studies.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.140
What are you doing?

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.540
(Music and Dance Academy)

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.100
You're back, my lady.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:08.420
You...

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.900
What's the smell?

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.100
What's so smelly?

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.100
It's too smelly.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.380
Get lost!

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.500
Who asked you to come over?

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.180
How dare you say that I'm smelly?

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.020
Why do you always get mad at the Third Princess?

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.460
She's the daughter of Her Majesty.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.540
I just can't accept it.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.140
Chuchu is better than her in every respect

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.140
but Her Majesty always likes Chen Qianqian

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.500
and picks on Chuchu.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.940
I know you and the Second Princess
are good friends.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.220
Don't worry.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.260
The Second Princess is sure to be

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.220
the Crown Princess to the City Owner.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.820
The Third Princess has such a bad reputation.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.180
She's not worthy.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:44.700
That's true.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.500
Chen Qianqian is lacking in virtue.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.220
How can she be the City Owner?

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.140
Wait.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.700
Are these all given by Chen Qianqian?

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:00.660
Yes.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.500
Her things are not allowed to be here.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.180
You always flirt with each other.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.540
She embarrassed me today.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.020
I'll vent my anger on her man!

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:10.660
My lady,

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.820
he's also your man.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.540
What if you beat him to death?

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.540
Lin Qi beat you?

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.900
I infuriated Miss Lin

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.860
and she ordered me

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.460
to return these things to you.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.660
Lin Qi has obviously sent you

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.860
to piss me off.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.900
She's too unruly.

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:45.740
I displeased her

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:47.540
and she took it all out on you.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.340
She wasn't hitting you

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.820
but me.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.180
Your Highness, don't mind it.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.340
It didn't hurt when she whipped me.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.580
But if

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.100
you're angered,

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.140
my heart

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.580
will ache.
