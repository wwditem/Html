=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 12)

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.860
Yingying,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.580
what happened to you?

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.140
Did they punish you?

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.660
Your Highness,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.940
in order to protect you,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.180
I sneaked into the enemy
and almost got killed.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.380
I could have been dead.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.460
Young Master, Chuchu,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.380
he has suffered a lot.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.380
I don't think he exposed the camp site

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.460
on purpose.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.980
Let's spare him this time.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.500
Perhaps we should send him back.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.700
That's right.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.980
So, you're not gonna stick to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.380
the seven times of capture and release thing?

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.340
Hey...

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.020
Where did you get the jade pendant?

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.020
Jade pendant?

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.300
It's a family heirloom.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.940
It's one of a kind.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.820
It was broken

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.340
into two pieces.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.180
I must have chipped it

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.780
by accident.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.740
I found the other half of the jade pendant

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.140
in the trap.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.340
Did you break it

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.180
while you were setting the trap?

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.260
It was my fault.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.620
I arranged all of this.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.140
It has nothing to do with Her Highness.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.980
Yingying!

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.420
What arrangement did you make?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.060
Get me trapped, of course.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.380
I just don't understand

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.380
why you asked him to do this.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.660
No, no, Chuchu.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.980
It was a mistake. I just...

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.620
You just want me to get trapped

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.500
so that Meng Guo could capture me.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.620
However,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.860
your people lit the fire

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.780
which attracted Meng Guo here.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.620
No, no, no. I...

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.620
Your Highness,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.660
you're accusing Her Highness unjustly.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.260
She found out that you had a crush
on Young Master Han,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.700
so she asked me to trap you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.260
so that Young Master Han
could come to your rescue.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.060
She was trying to fix you up
with Young Master Han.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.460
Anyway, she was doing this for your good.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.380
She was definitely not setting you up.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.660
Why are you explaining everything?

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.540
Didn't you say it has nothing to do with me?

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.540
But I can't just let you be wronged.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.820
So, you mean,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.020
what he said is true?

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.340
Chen Qianqian,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.380
I used to think of you as a willful girl.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.860
But now,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.620
I find out that you don't have a heart.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.300
Chuchu, please forgive me. I...

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.140
I don't blame you.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.660
In fact, I should be thanking you.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.220
If you really want me to have him,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.300
you should do more of this stuff.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.060
If you do this a few times,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.420
he'll get over you.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.500
I'm gonna peel it off.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.860
Young Master Han,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.500
I brought this medicine from Huayuan City.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.300
Let me get you patched up.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.020
Qianqian is naughty.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.660
Please don't take it personally.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.540
Women enjoy a high status

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.940
in Huayuan City.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.700
In her eyes,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.020
you're no different than a new toy,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.820
something she'd toss aside
when she has lost interest.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.220
You need to get over this.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.740
Your Highness is so considerate,

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.020
unlike your younger sister.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.820
Bai Ji,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.140
what are you doing here?

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.780
You got injured because of me.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.940
I'm here to give you some medicine.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.100
Thanks.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.420
How come you know that I like...

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.700
Your injury...

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.740
Why Han Shuo is wearing

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.180
Chuchu's sachet?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.020
Please take care of yourself.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.300
Now I'll take my leave.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.300
Apologies for my abruptness.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.300
I should go now.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.500
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.220
He said he was irritated.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.700
But his body was telling a different story.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.900
They got so close
when she put medicine on him.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.140
How could he say that I don't have a heart?

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.220
Come on, I was trying
to fix him up with Chuchu

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.940
with my whole heart!

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.340
The screenwriter should be blamed.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.260
How could she blame me
for the character she created?

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.260
When did Su Ziying

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.020
get injured?

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.740
I think he was faking it.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.060
Why did Young Master Chen keep defending him?

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.980
Keep an eye on him.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.980
I want to know

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.180
why Pei Heng

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.860
sent him to Qianqian.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.700
Understood.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.380
It's difficult terrain in Weimeng Mountain.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.260
Meng Guo has occupied
the place for a long time.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.460
He knows well the local terrain and climate.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.700
He is likely to...

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.940
Perhaps I should leave them alone.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.260
Let's go.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.860
...put it here.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.900
Young Master Chen,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.180
Stop!

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.180
Come down here.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.540
Come back.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.180
Stand right there.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.740
Well, you guys go on the discussion.
I'll go upstairs.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.580
Suppressing the bandits
seems really easy for you.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.700
You have left the job

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.860
to Her Highness and Young Master Han.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.740
Now, you don't even
care enough to give orders.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.060
Zi Zhu, what are you talking about?

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.340
I didn't say that I'll stay out of this.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.460
The stockade is located in the woods,
in the downwind direction.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:02.940
We could use...

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.860
Fire attack!

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.060
Fire attack.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.340
It's a low-lying area. The back hill...

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.020
Here!

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.460
Water attack.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.300
It's easy for you to say.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.900
You only need to say the words.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.580
But Her Highness and Young Master Han
have to do the work.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.700
They've been exhausted these days.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.620
Zi Zhu, mind your words.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.980
When I keep silent,

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.460
you'd say I'm not helping.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.660
When I say something,

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.020
you'd say I'm just saying.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.860
You're very resourceful.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.140
No wonder you can come up
with the trap thing.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.660
Don't you think so?

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.820
Not really.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.100
If I'm that resourceful,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.860
you wouldn't have found out what I did.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.300
It seems you

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.540
has been worried

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.060
about me and Her Highness.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.340
It's necessary
to have some brain-boosting dishes.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.700
Bai Ji?

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.460
I'm here.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.900
Tell her

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.860
what we're gonna have today.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:18.980
Steamed pigeon.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.100
Braised pigeon.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.820
Fried pigeon.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.900
Roasted pigeon.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.460
Stewed pigeon.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.220
All about pigeons?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.820
Where did you get so many pigeons?

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.820
Perhaps Pei Heng

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.020
wants to keep you full.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.060
Bai Ji, let's go.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.460
Keep me full?

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.060
(Pei's Mansion)

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.940
Sir.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.700
Any news from Weimeng Mountain?

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.700
None of the homing pigeons

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.820
have come back.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.460
How come?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.740
I heard that Young Master Chen

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.340
had arrested Meng Guo the bandit.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.020
Young Master Chen
is courageous and resourceful.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.180
It's a good thing

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.780
for Your Majesty and the city.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.700
Congratulations.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.420
Finally, she has done a good job.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.580
May Young Master Chen return in triumph!

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.580
May Young Master Chen return in triumph!

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.060
Report!

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.300
We got news from Weimeng Mountain.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.420
When will she come back?

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.580
She is not coming back for some time.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.100
Perhaps she is having fun out there.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.060
Alright, just let her.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.820
Get Meng Guo here first.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.060
Your Majesty, please calm down.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.980
Young Master Chen
has released Meng Guo again.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.620
What?

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.420
Again?

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.060
How many times did she

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.420
release him after the arrest?

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.740
Please calm down.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.420
Please calm down.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.860
Perhaps Young Master Chen
is doing this for fun.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.540
I beg to differ.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.700
Young Master Chen is a smart girl.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.700
I don't think she'd miss the big picture.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.300
She must have done this

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.140
for a purpose.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.100
This is ridiculous.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.460
I would love to know

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.060
what she is trying to do.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.820
Please go on with the banquet.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.660
Sangqi,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.220
has Your Majesty got any other news

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.740
about Qianqian?

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.780
You, come over here.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:57.380
You're Su Mu, the most popular musician
of the Music and Dance Academy, aren't you?

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:03.340
Since when do you start
paying visit to the Mansion?

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.420
Like I said,

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.900
I wouldn't

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.220
put it past Young Master Chen.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.900
Please let us know

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.940
when you decide to return
to the Music and Dance Academy.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.340
Come on.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.860
Drink it.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.140
Come on.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.180
Su Mu, come over here.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.700
This is a thank-you gift

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.820
for your taking care of me these days.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.660
Your Highness, I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.420
I'm just a musician.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.060
How could a humble person like me...

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.940
You're a guest of honor in this house.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.940
No one is to look down on you.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.180
Since when has Su Mu been
in the good graces of Her Highness?

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.660
Now everyone has to treat him with dignity.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.500
That's right.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.620
How do you know
that I was pretending to surrender?

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.500
It's not the seventh time yet.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.140
There is no way
you would seriously surrender.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.940
You're so smart.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.460
This time,

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.940
are you gonna release me as before?

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.220
Yes!

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.820
The whole thing is easy for you
because you didn't do the work yourself.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.180
How many times have we done this?

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.140
Do you really plan to repeat
the whole thing seven times?

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.740
The wise man?

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.620
Military counselor?

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.980
Does he even know anything
about the art of war?

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.820
Chuchu,

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.100
Meng Guo is a brave and simple guy.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.540
Once he is totally convinced,

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.900
he'd be a gallant soldier for us.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.620
Chuchu,

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.580
we only need to do this one more time.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.620
This is the one last time,

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.900
we shouldn't give up.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.380
That's right, give me one more chance.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.620
Give him a chance.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.420
Your Highness,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.820
Young Master Chen is in charge of this.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.140
We'd better let her make the decision

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.860
in case you get in trouble.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.060
By now,

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.380
the Mansion must have got the news.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.300
Release him.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.020
Cut me loose.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.220
Do it quickly.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.700
Tomorrow in the noon,

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.380
I'll meet you
at the place 5 km from the camp.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.980
Have a safe trip home!

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.180
See you!

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.380
Tomorrow,

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.460
we're gonna have the final battle.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.940
We'll be divided into two groups.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.140
I'll be luring

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.540
the enemy in

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.380
while Young Master Han and Chuchu

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.820
will capture Meng Guo

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.740
by outflanking him from the back.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.420
I have no objection.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.740
Young Master Han, what's your take on this?

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.740
Do you really want me
to be on the same team with Her Highness?

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.580
Fine.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.980
However, if the plan doesn't work out

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.020
and we couldn't come to your rescue

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.380
while you're confronting Meng Guo,

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.420
what then?

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.500
Meng Guo once claimed

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.540
that he'd capture you alive and possess you.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.580
Can you guess what he is trying to do?

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.780
You're young and beautiful.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.820
If you end up in his hands...

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.180
Oh my God!

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.620
I need to think
of some way to protect myself.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.540
So, what's your plan

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.860
for tomorrow?

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.420
It seems

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.900
I mustn't go solo tomorrow.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.220
Then who do you want to work with?

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.060
Chuchu?

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.100
I'd rather not.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.900
I'm afraid you'll release him again

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.940
after we arrest him.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.620
How about...

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.980
I won't release him.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.140
Not this time.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.260
I won't let him go.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:23.860
Qianqian, you can...

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.020
Chuchu?

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:28.780
Your Highness,

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.660
if Mr. Pei is here,

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.780
he'll protect you with his life.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.660
He cares about you so much

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.620
that he sent me
to take care of you all the time.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.940
However, to his disappointment,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.460
I wasn't competent enough

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.420
and failed to protect you.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.700
That's right.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.580
Perhaps you should join Pei Heng.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.420
What are you talking about?

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.820
Pei Heng is like a thousand miles away.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.420
You could bring his portrait along with you

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.820
and burn some incense.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.940
That should work.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:57.740
Bring his portrait?

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.980
I might as well bring yours

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.500
since you look far
more intimidating than him.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.180
Your portrait must work better.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.420
So, you will bring my portrait?

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.900
Then why wouldn't you work with me?

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.540
When did I say that?

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.780
You've been bossy to me.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.380
Why would I get myself into such trouble?

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.700
Please calm down, Your Highness.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.300
You could stay at the camp

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.340
while Young Master Han
and Her Highness go separate ways.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.580
You'll just have to wait here.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.620
That way, I'll still be all
by myself at the camp.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.660
Do you really consider staying at the camp?

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:35.260
Well...

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.140
Anyway,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
you just don't want to be by my side, do you?

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:39.980
I... I...

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.620
Mr. Han, don't worry,

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.100
I'll protect Her Highness with my life.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.260
Bai Ji,

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.900
let's go.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:55.900
Chuchu?

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.700
Tomorrow, Young Master Chen
will be guarding the camp.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.020
In case anything happens,

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.780
let off fireworks
to send the distress signal.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.500
Understood.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.220
(The Inn)

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.020
Zi Rui, let off the fireworks!

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.500
Here you are.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.300
We're so dead.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.020
Your Highness,

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.700
I don't think anyone
will come to the rescue now.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.340
Our luck has run out.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.980
Report!

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:16.820
Mr. Han,

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.780
the scout said

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.380
Meng Guo and his guys have passed
Her Highness's ambush

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.340
and made his way to our camp.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.340
Oh my God!

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.900
Meng Guo took Young Master Chen away.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.300
Meng Guo once claimed

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.300
that he'd capture you alive and possess you.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.340
Can you guess what he is trying to do?

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.540
You're young and beautiful.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.900
If you end up in his hands...

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.980
(Owner of Xuanhu City)
What is it? The vision board?

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:25.820
Does a bandit

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.980
have KPI?

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.180
Occupy Huayuan City and destroy Xuan...

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.540
In your dream!

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.740
That's never going to happen.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.220
Get the Dragon Bone.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.340
That's my fault.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.980
I'll fix it.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.140
Capture Young Master Chen...

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.660
Well, you actually did it.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.820
Mr. Meng, you want to have the ceremony now?

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.500
Yes.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.580
No time like the present.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.700
The sooner, the better.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:54.980
Understood.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.180
The ceremony?

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.740
What ceremony? Is he forcing me to marry him?

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.140
What are you doing?

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.660
Listen,

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.380
I've released you so many times.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.100
Shouldn't you release me this time?

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.580
It's called reciprocity.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.700
If you won't let me go,

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.340
just sit down with me.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.420
Listen,

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.100
don't hurt me,

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.340
or Han Shuo will come after you.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.380
He will definitely come to my rescue.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.300
If you hurt me,

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:41.980
he will show you no mercy.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:42.860
When he is irritated,

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.820
you have no idea what he is capable of.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.300
I'm not looking.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.220
Meng Guo!

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.060
I am the Crown Princess of Huayuan City.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.380
There is no way

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.820
I'll surrender to a gang of bandits.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:02.940
Take one more step,

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.340
I'll kill myself

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.620
right in front of you!

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.220
Young Master, this is all mistaken.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.820
What is the situation now?

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.900
Young Master,

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.420
your mom sent you here
to suppress the bandits.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.820
But you released me
every time you arrested me.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.820
Do you know why?

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.580
Why?

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.780
Because you think highly
of me and want to test me.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.060
You can tell all that.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.940
You see good qualities

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.580
in me.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.420
Yes.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.740
You're the person who discovers me.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.900
This is your grace to me.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.420
You keep your word by arresting
and releasing me for six times.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.500
This is your loyalty to me.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.300
You've treated me with nothing
but grace and loyalty.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.260
I must

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.900
pay you back.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.940
Pay me back?

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.100
By kidnapping me over here
to have the wedding ceremony?

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.340
Wedding ceremony?

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.180
No.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.740
The ceremony is about us
becoming sworn brothers.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.020
Being the ruler of Weimeng Mountain

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.460
is way more comfortable

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.220
than being the Crown Princess of Huayuan City.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.900
For the seventh time,

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.060
I arrested you.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.140
But I'd like to surrender myself.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.260
Zhuge Liang

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.460
really is a wise man.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.340
Mr. Meng,

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.700
from now on,

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.340
we're brother and sister unrelated by blood.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:55.820
As far as I'm concerned,

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.980
you're welcome to be the ruler

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:57.860
of Weimeng Mountain.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.100
Please don't say no.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.180
OK.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.380
I'll be the ruler here.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.980
Guys, greet her!

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.780
Young Master!

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.980
Mr. Meng!

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.780
Hey, you always

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.900
look down on women from Huayuan City.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.580
Why would you follow me now?

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.180
Though you're a woman,

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.140
you're so bold and resourceful

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.660
that even ten men are no match for you.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.740
Even I am no match for you.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.540
I'm totally okay with you being the leader.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.860
You're the bigger person.
I admire you for that.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.380
What smells so good?

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.300
We're having a feast

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.900
in your honor.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.380
Guys, let's get it started!

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.740
Okay.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.740
Young Master,

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.500
the stockade has been besieged.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.860
We can attack at any time.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.580
Young Master Han,

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.900
I just caught a bandit.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:43.980
We can get some information from him.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.220
Why are you people bustling in and out?

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.020
Mr. Meng ordered us to prepare a feast.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.220
We're having a ceremony today.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.500
What ceremony?

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.420
What else could it be?

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.540
The wedding ceremony

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.940
for Meng Guo
and Young Master Chen, of course.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.820
Bai Ji, give the order. Attack.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.540
Understood.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:01.620
Cheers.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.220
Cheers.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.660
Young Master Chen, your story
of seven times of capture and release

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.020
has become a legend

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.580
to be remembered.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.020
I'm so impressed.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.540
With you guiding us,

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.980
no one would dare suppress us.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:17.980
We'd conquer

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.260
every enemy we have.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.340
Let's drink the wine.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.020
Cheers.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.060
Let's keep a low profile.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.660
Let's keep a low profile.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.780
There is not much that I can promise,

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.180
but as long as you follow me,

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.620
the entire Huayuan City

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.100
will be ours.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.940
Great! Great!

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.100
However,

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.620
I want to make three statements.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.380
First,

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.420
we don't rob people's houses.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.060
Young Master,

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.540
never have we robbed someone poor.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.180
We only rob caravans that pass by.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.940
Second,

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.220
we don't kidnap women.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.420
Women are the ones who kidnap us.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.020
We only became bandits in the mountains

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.660
because we wouldn't accept that fate.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.460
Exactly.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.220
Exactly.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.300
Exactly.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.460
Alright, alright.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.820
Third,

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.500
have that character corrected.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.740
(Weimeng Stockage)

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.660
Did you see anything wrong?

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.380
(Stockade)

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.020
There you go.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.380
Pour the wine.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.020
Mr. Meng,

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.580
it seems Young Master Chen

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.540
miswrote the character.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.180
I have heard it long before

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.660
that Her Highness is illiterate.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.580
It turns out to be true.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.700
However, now that she is our leader,

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.100
let's do as she says.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.380
From now on, this is the one.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.300
Understood.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.340
Report!

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.220
What's up?

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:42.820
Mr. Meng,

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.020
a troop of soldiers has arrived
at the foot of the mountain.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.060
They're about to attack.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.260
It must be Han Shuo.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.380
There are so many of us.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.100
Besides, we have Young Master Chen.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.260
We don't need to be afraid of them.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.020
Han Shuo is Young Master Chen's husband,

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.420
making it inappropriate
to have a fight with them.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.220
Well...

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.940
Who dares to attack Weimeng Mountain?

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.380
Guys, let's go!

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.260
Who is attacking us?

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.180
Step aside. Step aside.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.140
Who is attacking us?

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.700
Who is the person in charge?

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:10.700
This way.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.180
Young Master, are you alright?

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.220
Young Master?

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:18.700
Why do you call me that?

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.060
Now, I'm the ruler of Weimeng Mountain.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.420
I'm no longer the Crown Princess.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.740
Where is Chuchu? She should be the Crown Princess.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.780
Young Master, please don't say that.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.780
Get over there.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.340
I,

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.540
I am the ruler of Weimeng Mountain.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.140
I am afraid of nobody.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.860
Chen Qianqian,

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.700
do you even remember why you were sent here?

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.900
Who is this?
He look quite handsome.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.420
What about coming with me
and becoming my husband?

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.900
He is your husband.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.100
Since when have I married
such a handsome man?

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.420
When and how did we get married?

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.780
You kidnapped him.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:18.780
I kidnapped him.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.660
I'll do it again.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.860
Let me check it.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.820
How many packs do you have?

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.540
How many packs?

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.100
Young Master, let's talk about it later.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:35.820
He is shy.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.700
Let's talk about it later.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.700
Turn around, all of you.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.620
You guys just look away.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.180
Stop it.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.780
Come back with me.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.020
You know what?

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.380
You look exactly like someone I know.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.420
He told me

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.380
that he'd protect me all the time.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.340
However, at a critical moment,

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.980
he got mad at me

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.060
and scared me with the bandit thing.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.900
In the end, he left me alone at the camp.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.420
It was my fault.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.620

What took you so long?

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.820
I was freaked out. I was...

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.540
Look at their swords.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.220
Those huge swords.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.740
It's okay. It's okay.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.220
It's okay. It's okay.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.660
It's okay. It's okay.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:49.700
It was all my fault.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.260

Young Master,

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.540
what about these people?

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.740
Now that you follow the leadership

of Qianqian,

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.060
you should come back to the camp with her.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.340

Let's go.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.180
Since when have I married
such a handsome man?

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.660
When and how did we get married?

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.020
You kidnapped him.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.660
I kidnapped him.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.260
Chen Qianqian,

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.740
you didn't make any progress

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.500
except on drinking.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.140
How dare you tempt him?

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.140
That will teach you to go easy on wine.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.700
Young Master Chen.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.660
Young Master Chen.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.300
Here is the refreshing soup for you.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.100
Su Ziying brought it by this morning,

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.140
saying it's for you.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.220
Your Highness!

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.860
Zi Rui, from now on,

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.220
keep a closer eye on Su Ziying.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.580
Prevent him from causing me any trouble.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.060
Understood.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.420
Take it away.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.220
Come in.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.060
Your Highness,
you've been exhausted these days.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.260
I prepared this nourishing soup for you.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.660
Hope you enjoy it.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.940
Leave it there. You're excused.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.820
Your Highness,

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.140
you'll recognize me

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.820
once you are reinstated
to the Crown Princess with my help.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.180
Did you find out anything?

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.260
What did you find out?

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.180
Did you see your young master?

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.060
Your Highness, you're awake.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.740
I have good news for you.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.580
We have suppressed the bandits
with our army intact.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:27.500
All of them have surrendered to us.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.020
Young Master is planning on the return.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:30.820
We're leaving tomorrow.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.820
Alright, alright.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.820
Young Master,
Her Highness is looking for you.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.220
Who told you to say...

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.980
Are you still mad at me?

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.620
Are you planning to never talk to me again?

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.580
I was wrong.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.860
I shouldn't get mad at you.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.700
I shouldn't scare you with the bandit thing.

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.100
I shouldn't freak you out

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.780
by leaving you alone at the camp.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.180
Yesterday, I was also frightened.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.620
I was thrilled

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.500
to see that you were fine.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.220
Actually, it's not completely your fault.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.180
It was I who screwed it up.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.940
Why were you

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.740
mad at me?

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.900
Why were you

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.060
setting me up with Her Highness?

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.780
That's because you two are supposed to...

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.580
Yes, I tried to approach your sister.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.740
But I didn't know you back then.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.020
You once said

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.380
that you need to learn what a person
likes before you give him a gift.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.780
It seems

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.340
you didn't stick to it

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.180
when it comes to setting me up with someone.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.820
Since you have kidnapped me,

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.580
you should see it through.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.140
Your Highness,

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.020
I'll see that you win over

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.900
the person you like.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.460
Today, we're not serving pigeons.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.900
Go hunting in the woods.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.220
Prepare some food for Qianqian.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:50.900
Understood.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.220
Sir.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.420
Young Master Han,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.300
I'm here to deliver a message
from Young Master Chen.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.060
She wants to meet you
at the storage room of the inn

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.220
this afternoon.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.420
She has something to tell you.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.940
The storage room?

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:16.820
Yes.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.620
Later, I want you to hide yourself.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.460
Once Young Master Han walks
into the storage room with the other person,

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.140
you lock the door immediately.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.620
Understood.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.460
Wait till the drug to take effect.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.500
You can rest assured of that.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.700
Young Master.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.100
Young Master, you're right about Su Ziying.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.300
He is up to something.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.660
He wants to lure Young Master Han
to the storage room.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.220
He even plans to drug him.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:52.740
What drug?

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:53.700
I don't know.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.060
Where is Han Shuo?

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.900
By now...

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:57.860
Get to the point!

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.420
He is on the way to the storage room.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.260
Su Ziying

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.180
has the blackest heart in the world.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.380
He even pulled one over on me.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.220
Young Master, where are you going?

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.140
To save him.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:08.900
I want you to get Su Ziying

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:09.860
under control.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.940
How am I supposed to do that?

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:46.740
Qian...

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.460
Han Shuo?

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.420
Han Shuo, are you alright?

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:07.940
Get up. Let's go.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.300
I'll get you out of here.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:13.620
Let's go.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.140
What are you doing?

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.180
What's wrong with you?

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.940
Stop it!

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:21.900
Just stop it!

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.660
Get out of here.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.540
I'm poisoned with aphrodisiac incense.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.620
Aphrodisiac incense?

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.460
Young Master Chen?

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:39.820
Zi Rui?

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.140
Zi Rui, open the door for me! Hurry up!

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:41.900
Okay.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.180
Help me!

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.180
Young Master Chen, the door is locked.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.020
I can't open it.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:45.940
I'll get some help.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.100
Hold on, hold on.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:47.860
Listen,

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.340
don't make it public.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.620
If you have no one to turn to,

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.740
just find Bai Ji.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.620
Understood.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.180
Young Master Chen, hang in there.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.260
Wait for me.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.940
I can hang in there.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.980
But I don't think Han Shuo can.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.180
Mr. Su!

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.540
Mr. Su!

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.780
Mr. Su, you're finally here.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.140
Han Shuo is already in there.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.740
Young Master Chen is in there, too.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.980
What? How come Young Master Chen is in there?

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:26.780
It's Young Master Han and the Second Princess

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.980
that I want to lock in there.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.140
What's the problem with you?

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.500
Didn't you say

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.900
Young Master Chen wanted to meet him here?

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.380
It was a lie.

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:36.940
How can you take it seriously?

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.460
Oh my God!

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.740
Young Master Han and Young Master Chen

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.420
are locked in the room.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.460
Where is the key?

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.180
I can't find it.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.500
Just look for it.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.260
I put it right there.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.580
Han Shuo,

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.700
stop right now or I'll hit you.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.180
Will it

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.340
kill him?

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.500
Who knocked me out?

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.660
Did Chen Qianqian suspect me?

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.140
Put on the clothes.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.220
It's cold here.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.580
Bai Ji will come for me

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.340
when he finds out that I'm missing.

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.420
Han Shuo, listen to me,

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.380
this is the time for the hero

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.740
to show his decency.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.100
You must survive the ordeal.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.660
Your Highness! Your Highness!

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.780
Are you in there?

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.780
Su Ziying?

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.860
I couldn't find you anywhere.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.100
It turns out you're locked in.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.100
Get me out of here.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.740
I'll think of some way to help you.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:49.420
When I get out of here,

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.940
I'll leave you to Han Shuo for disposal.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:54.460
All screenwriters write about
aphrodisiac incense that way.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.580
I just jumped on the bandwagon.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.660
However, in the original script,

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:57.780
Su Ziying used this drug

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.420
to fling Han Shuo and Chuchu together.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.140
I never expected

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.020
this would happen to me.
