=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 10)

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500
Lin Qi fears rats the most.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.740
So I put 27 rats into her chamber.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.340
I'll see what she will look like tomorrow.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.940
She wanted to beat me?

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.020
Lin Qi is no match for me at all.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.860
I will scare her to death.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.900
How do you feel now? Are you still angry?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.140
It is avenging you on her,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.820
not me.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.540
It was a competition.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.860
We have signed a disclaimer.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.700
We can't seek revenge.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.540
I don't like fighting and killing.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.100
Your Highness is so kind.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.500
Kind?

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.300
I'd rather say Her Highness is so mean.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.860
I caught 27 rats for her.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.380
It made me exhausted.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.460
At least Her Highness is kinder

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.620
than Young Master Han.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.460
Young Master Han and the Third Princess,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.620
one is ruthless and the other is mean.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.940
They are well matched.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.660
Zi Rui. Let's go.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.300
OK.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.180
It is my negligence.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.580
There is an escaped...rat.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.140
Hey, take it away

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.860
from me, Bai Ji.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.500
Farther away.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.420
Go. Zi Rui. Go.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.260
Young Master.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.220
Please give me a chance
to make up for my mistake.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.180
Not necessary.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.980
I will reward you.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.180
But...

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.900
(City Owner's Mansion)

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.340
The third test. Discourse on politics.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.780
This time, the question is
about current politics.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.540
Now, in Huayuan City,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.900
the silver reserve is decreasing
and financial condition is bad.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.700
Would you please tell me

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.140
if you have any good advice
on increasing revenue?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.740
Mother, I have a piece of good advice.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.980
Tell me.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.060
We could increase head tax.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.500
First, this tax can guarantee
financial income.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.580
Second, it can control population,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.740
so that population will not
increase too quickly

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.020
and become a burden on the economy.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.380
As far as I know,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.620
Huayuan City has a total
population of 150,000,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.820
in which 105,000 are adults.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.180
If every adult

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.620
pays 120 qians of silver
for head tax every year,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.740
our income will increase a lot every year.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.020
If they do not have silver,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.780
they also can pay the tax with grain.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.660
In that case,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.300
our grain will also increase a lot.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.540
They are necessary for unexpected needs.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.500
Well.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.860
Is there anyone

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.900
who can calculate it for me?

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.540
Minister Liu, what do you say?

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.420
105,000 people.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.980
Everyone pays 120 qians
of silver every year.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.020
1,000 qians is equal to one tael.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.940
It can be exchanged for 200 dous of rice.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.220
It means...

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.940
Your Majesty.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.300
It means an increase
of 100,000 taels of silver

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.460
or millions of dous of rice.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.140
I never thought that
the Third Princess was so brilliant.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.260
If such amount of income
is increased every year,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.140
the difficulties Huayuan City is facing now

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.060
will be overcome.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.460
Brilliant. Brilliant.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.740
Her Highness is a governing talent.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.300
It is a blessing for Huayuan City.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.500
Wait.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.260
Your Highness. Something seems to be wrong.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.060
Does Minister Liu have a question?

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.020
Huayuan City has a total
population of 150,000,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.740
in which 105,000 are adults.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.900
Your Highness.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.820
Have you included men in the calculation?

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.500
Of course.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.100
Men and women

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.300
are all adults.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.780
They all should pay the tax.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.980
It seems that the Third Princess's
knowledge of political affairs

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.300
is not as good as the Second Princess.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.780
In Huayuan City,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.100
people who pay tax should
enjoy relevant rights.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.220
If women pay tax, their social status
will be higher than that of men.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.220
If men also pay tax,

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.940
doesn't it mean that we have
admitted the rights of men?

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.020
By that time,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.540
men will be officials and businessmen.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.580
They will have the same
social status with women.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.780
The Third Princess is trying
to set a trap for Her Majesty.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.260
If men pay tax, they will
become heads of households.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.660
That is unacceptable.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.900
If men have rights,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.580
what will become of Huayuan City?

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.940
Its foundation will be damaged.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.260
If that is so,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.460
we may as well change the name
of Huayuan City into Xuanhu City.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.900
Did the Third Princess have her brain damaged

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.460
in the Kung Fu test?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.940
It is not easy to win,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.540
but it is easy to loss.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.500
Qianqian.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.500
You are a princess of Huayuan City,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.860
but you disregard the dignity
of our ancestors.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.780
It is disgraceful.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.380
Mother.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.780
I am too naive.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.380
Please still consider me to be a baby.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.220
Sorry for my childish words.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.020
It is OK.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.660
Since Qianqian is still a baby,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.860
let's not talk about it anymore.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.900
Baby?

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.580
Next.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.660
I have a piece of advice.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.620
Xuanhu City makes black stones into bombs,

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.340
while Huayuan City makes
black stones into fireworks.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.460
Your Highness. Look.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.100
These are clothes and jewelry.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.780
They are at a standard equal to those
for the Crown Princess.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.260
Later, when I give these presents to Chuchu,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.740
she will be very happy.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.740
Congratulations! Chuchu.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.980
Now you are the winner
of the discourse on politics.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.060
Congratulations to you.
You are the winner of the Kung Fu test.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.340
You know that I won the Kung Fu test

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.340
with some tactics.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.260
When the results
of the literacy test come out,

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.340
you will be

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.820
the Crown Princess.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.780
Look.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.060
I have prepared presents for you.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.780
We only need to wait
for mother's order of coronation.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:57.980
Presents?

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.460
For me?

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.180
Chuchu, think about my bet.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.100
I will become rich because of you.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.180
How is your wound?

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.980
I have been preparing
for the discourse test these days.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.340
I didn't have time to see you.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.460
It doesn't matter. It is a small wound.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.300
It has been cured by the medicine
given by Yuanyuan.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.660
(Auspiciousness lights up the virtuous household)

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.460
Following the god's will,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.780
we hereby announce the results
of the Crown Princess Election.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.180
The winner of the first place
in the discourse on politics

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.060
is the Second Princess Chen Chuchu.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.700
The winner of the first place
in the Kung Fu test

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.060
The winner of the first place
in the Kung Fu test

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.540
is the Third Princess Chen Qianqian.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.020
Without me,

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.100
Chen Qianqian couldn't win.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.940
The winner of the first place
in the literacy test

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.820
The winner...

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.180
Your Majesty. This...

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.220
The winner of the first place
in the literacy test

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.420
is the Third Princess Chen Qianqian.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.860
It is her.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.620
How could she win the first place?

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.380
This

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.900
is ridiculous.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.020
How strange!

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.380
The literacy test...I am the winner?

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.340
Congratulations to Your Highness.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.740
Am I the winner?

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.500
The Third Princess Chen Qianqian

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.380
has brilliant literary ability

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.940
and excellent Kung Fu skills.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.220
She is also a governing talent.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.860
She is capable of shouldering
great responsibilities.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.100
Therefore, she is conferred
the title of Crown Princess,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.940
in order to make the city more prosperous
and protect Huayuan City.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.980
Mother.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.500
I am not suitable.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.980
I can't be the Crown Princess.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.940
Qianqian.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.500
You have been intelligent
and diligent since childhood.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.300
I always have great expectations for you.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.940
You have won the election,

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.540
you should be the Crown Princess.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.220
Why do you refuse?

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.860
I have neither talent nor virtue.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.620
Chuchu...

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.980
Chuchu is more suitable to be the Crown Princess.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:03.980
Please let Chuchu be the Crown Princess.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.180
I am not good enough.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.700
Chuchu. Do you agree?

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.220
Qianqian has been intelligent
since childhood.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.940
I am willing to assist her.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.180
I will be faithful to her.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.500
No. No.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.620
It is settled.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.740
Qianqian. Go back home
and prepare for the coronation.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.140
I am tired after a few busy days.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.620
Mother. No.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:27.540
Mother.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.260
Dismiss.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.340
Mother! No! Mother!

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.060
Mother. Chuchu. Chuchu.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.100
Chuchu. Chuchu.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.060
Please don't go. Please don't go.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.700
Your highness.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.260
Please don't go.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.420
All is ready.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.180
What are Your Highness trying to explain?

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.620
You have prepared everything for yourself.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.500
Don't pretend to be kind.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.300
Chuchu.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.460
Congratulations to you.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.900
Now you are the Crown Princess.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.620
Chuchu.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.700
The Third Princess.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.220
No, I mean Crown Princess.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.820
Now you have won the whole Huayuan City.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.540
Why are you still not happy?

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.540
It seems that I have won the whole city,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.620
but actually I have lost the whole world.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.580
Completely.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.860
I have lost all my fortune.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:11.940
No.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.220
Why did I win?

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.100
You said I would lose
if I stuck to what I like.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.780
What should I do?

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.380
Why are you dressed like this?

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.820
Right. You also bet that Chuchu would win.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.380
Didn't you also bet on the Second Princess?

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.540
You...

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.100
Dismiss.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.300
You are useless.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.940
Nothing has been done and money is gone.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.700
And I have to tell stories to you every day.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.500
You. You...

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.300
You are the so-called braggers.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.900
You do nothing except

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.100
bragging.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.020
Your Highness. Please don't discard us.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.020
Yes.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.340
We still don't understand the relationship

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.380
among banana, orange and apple.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.620
If we don't listen to your stories for one day,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.140
we will feel agitated.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.020
I will stop the project
of banana, orange and apple.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.140
I can't afford you anymore.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.660
The relations of characters are a mess.
I am done with it.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.060
Minister Pei.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.220
Do you want to see how miserable I am?

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.540
I know that you are a proud lady.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.060
It is not strange

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.380
that you feel upset about your defeat.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.980
I am here to comfort you.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.380
Yes.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.860
I have worked hard since I was a child.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.660
But my mother's most favorite daughter

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.140
is always Qianqian.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.420
She blatantly played tricks
in the Kung Fu test,

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.700
but mother judged that she won.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.260
She acted wildly
and talked nonsense in the hall,

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.420
but mother was reluctant to punish her.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.780
No matter how hard I work,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.460
I won't be appreciated by mother.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.820
Even though Qianqian is mischievous,

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.300
she is adored by my mother.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.220
I am also a daughter of my mother.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.420
Why does she treat us differently?

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.900
She who loves well chastises well.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.980
Maybe Her Majesty

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.340
has higher expectations for you.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.140
That's why she is stricter with you.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.740
Higher expectations?

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.780
In the past, I would believe these words.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.300
But now,

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.820
mother has conferred her
the title of Crown Princess.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.820
I am not well today.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.980
Sorry for the snub.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.060
Please take care.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.700
Crown Princess said

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.180
that she bet all her money on you.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.220
But do you know

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.860
that Young Master Han bet all his money

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.140
on the Crown Princess.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.740
He has earned a lot of money.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.260
They were just playing tricks.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.580
Your Highness have been deceived.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.460
Are you sure?

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.260
Money have been sent to Yueli Mansion.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.660
Please don't be angry, Your Highness.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.780
It is my fault.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.780
I underestimated Chen Qianqian.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.100
I won't believe a word
of what she says in future.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.100
Why did you ask me to come here?

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.500
Young Master bet a lot of money

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.940
that Your Highness would win
the title of Crown Princess.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.060
He wanted to give you a surprise.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.660
He never expected that

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.420
the odds were so high.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.140
Let me put it this way:

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.460
now our mansion

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.140
is the biggest winner
in the whole Huayuan City.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.660
What do you mean?

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.620
Is my money back?

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.060
Actually,

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.180
we should say that your money

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.260
was spent by you

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.740
and then earned back by me.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.500
During the process,

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.660
I also earned some interest.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.740
So it's you that helped me
win the literacy test.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.620
Please don't thank me.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.700
I said that

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.380
I will give you what you want.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.380
You...

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.060
I...

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:17.980
You...

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.700
You are coquettish.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.940
What does that mean?

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.740
You are truly the Crown Prince of Xuanhu City.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.300
You're so dense.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.740
What does "dense" mean?

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:29.980
It means handsome.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.340
But I think you are mad at me.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.180
Do you know that
you are a danger to your wife?

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:35.780
I...

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.140
I never said that I wanted
to be the Crown Princess.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:38.980
But...

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.900
I have heard for a long time
that the Third Princess is capricious.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.940
Now I know it is true.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.180
I helped you to win
the title of Crown Princess.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.340
I don't know what's wrong with it.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.300
Before you give me anything,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.780
can you ask me if I like it?

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.420
How could you not like

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.300
what I sent you?

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.020
Your Highness.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.420
Auspicious clothes
for the parade have arrived.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.780
I don't want to be the Crown Princess,

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.180
but this dress is so beautiful.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:25.980
(Many talents compete in splendor)

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.020
Your Highness. This ceremonial dress

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.300
is made of fine silk fabrics.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.060
It is very expensive.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.900
You will ride a horse on the street,

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.740
offer sacrifices to heaven at the ancestral
temple, and meet Her Majesty.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.860
You will be the most magnificent

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.900
Crown Princess of Huayuan City ever.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.300
Why do I have to parade,
offer sacrifices and bow again?

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.580
They were all exempted when I got married.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.100
Can't we get away with them this time?

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.420
Why did he come?

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.540
He is your husband, isn't he?

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.580
According to the ancestral rules,

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.500
you should attend
the coronation ceremony together.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.340
You...

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.780
You see. Her Highness

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.740
is ungrateful.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.060
Young Master actually did it
for the good of her.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.700
Her Highness didn't need his help.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.620
Let me tell you.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.540
A right present is a surprise.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.100
A wrong present is a scare.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.860
Do you know what love is?

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.820
You sound like you understand it.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.260
Of course I understand.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.580
Whatever I do,

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.620
I do it for the good of Her Highness.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.300
Yes, it is true.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.540
But you are a little stupid.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.820
You made 500 bamboo tubes,

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.380
as if you were afraid that
others could not find out.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.220
You

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.620
just like talking about others' weakness.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.140
Don't think that I don't know it.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.980
On the day of bridegroom snatching,
you wanted to trap the Second Princess,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.460
but in the end you trapped Her Highness.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.620
You are unable to accomplish anything.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.340
You are liable to spoil everything.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:17:59.980
You are unable to accomplish anything.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.460
You are liable to spoil everything.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.060
You are unable to accomplish anything.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:01.900
You are liable to spoil everything.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.780
the Third Princess is coming.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.540
Since you didn't like it,

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.700
why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.980
I just never expected that
you would come up with such a big plan.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.940
You even interfered in the succession affair.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.260
Since ancient times, as long as
power struggle has been involved,

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.700
it has always meant life and death.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:24.900
Do you know that someone behind you

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.580
may set you up?

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.020
If you don't fight,

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.700
you will get a blow
and face numerous disasters.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.300
Let's not talk about anything else.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.700
Isn't my disaster sitting beside me?

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.540
We are a couple.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.140
How could I harm you?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:41.940
Are we a couple?

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.140
Have we worshiped Heaven?

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.740
Have we slept together?

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.260
Have we bowed to Heaven and Earth?

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:44.860
Have we paraded?

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.420
Aren't we parading now?

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.980
Later, we will worship Heaven.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.100
If you are not satisfied,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.500
We can bow to Heaven and Earth later.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.340
If that is not enough, we can

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.780
sleep together.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.220
In your dreams.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.420
Stop the cart.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.740
Why did the cart stop?

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.140
Your Highness.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.060
You...

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.300
Do you think that we are not a couple

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.340
because we haven't completed
the marriage ceremony?

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.500
Without bowing to Heaven and Earth,
worshiping Heaven, and parading.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.260
You are also trying to ruin this parade.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.900
Excuse me. It is you who stopped the cart.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.500
If Your Highness doesn't
want to parade with me,

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:31.980
I shall leave.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.420
Han Shuo. Sorry. That is not what I meant.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.140
I...

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.100
Han Shuo. Stop.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.380
Han Shuo. I think you misunderstood me.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.900
I really don't want to be the Crown Princess.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.460
On the day when you were poisoned,

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.500
you said

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.940
you were crying all day

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.700
after losing the qualification
for attending Crown Princess Election.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.980
Now you said you didn't want
to be the Crown Princess.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.020
I really don't know

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:03.980
what's on your mind.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.540
Fortunately, I have recovered
from the heart disease.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.460
Otherwise,

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.580
I would die today.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.420
Yes.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.540
I have cured your heart disease.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.300
I cured you with Dragon Bone.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.140
You took Dragon Bone just because you felt guilty.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.620
You falsely accused me of communicating
with the spy of Xuanhu City.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.140
I was almost killed by the Second Princess.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.780
That was because I was afraid of you.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.740
In the past, you looked like
a tiger eyeing its prey.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:25.620
When I was in Yueli Mansion,

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.580
I haven't had a good meal.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.540
When I faced a table of glazed plates,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.300
I felt like I was drawing lots.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.380
Your Highness was so cautious.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.300
Do you have any secret?

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.100
The thing happened in
the Music and Dance Academy

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.380
was a humiliation to me.
I was embarrassed in public.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.940
Why do you only hold grudges?

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.620
Do you forget what I did good for you?

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.940
Do you remember I lied that I was pregnant

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.740
and saved you from the death row.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.260
The way I treated you...

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.020
Why was I in prison?

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.780
Wasn't it you who set me up?

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.500
In the past,

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.700
we weren't getting along
well with each other,

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:04.740
were we?

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.260
I thought that you were going to poison me.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.740
You forced me to be your husband
on the street.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.700
On the street.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.340
On this very street.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:12.940
Yes.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.700
You forced me to marry you.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.780
Otherwise, I would not poison you
in the bridal chamber.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:17.540
You are shameless to say that.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.180
I...

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.180
Why did I force you to marry me?

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.860
Because you seduced me.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.860
Besides, I know that

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.180
the person you wanted to save
was not me, but Chuchu.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.420
Young Master. It is our fault in this case.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.420
How did she know?

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.780
I don't know.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.220
I am the Young Master of Xuanhu.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.460
How can I quarrel with a woman in the street?

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.540
Woman?

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.340
What's wrong with woman?

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.420
Please don't talk to me
in that discriminatory language.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.700
Let me tell you.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.300
In this world, only men and villains

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.180
are hard to get along with.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.220
Since you don't want me
to parade with you,

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.820
Please parade by yourself.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.580
Fine.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.660
Dress. Dress.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:15.980
Wha...

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.900
What is going on?

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.060
This is ridiculous.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.780
Han Shuo is tearing Qianqian's dress

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.660
in public

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.180
to humiliate his wife.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.340
The men of Xuanhu City really
don't respect their wives.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.100
They don't know how to sever women
and are unfaithful.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.700
He is not good enough for Qianqian.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.100
What are you looking at?

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.820
Han Shuo. Han Shuo. Don't go.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.540
Han Shuo. I hate you.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.900
It seems that the Crown Princess
doesn't like Young Master Han.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.820
Qianqian spends time in
the Music and Dance Academy every evening.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.180
When it comes to love affairs,

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.820
she only fancies something new.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.100
Han Shuo is so pathetic.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.780
He loves her so much.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.380
As far as I am concerned,

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.700
Your Highness is a natural fit
with Young Master Han.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.500
Though the Crown Princess kidnapped the bridegroom,

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.340
she will return him back eventually.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.340
I was stripped off clothes in the parade.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.780
What should it be called?

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.980
The Emperor's New Clothes.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.940
It is disgraceful.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.260
Your Highness. Please don't angry.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.980
Would you like to have an orange?

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.140
Peel the orange?

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.300
That's bad luck. Peel a banana.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.020
Yes.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.820
Young Master.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.420
Luckily you walked on the street.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.300
If I gave you a horse,

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.300
wouldn't you have dragged me

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.780
all the way down the street?

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.820
I don't want to see the bana...

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.260
you anymore.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.180
Your Highness.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.060
What is this?

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.740
Now you are the Crown Princess.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.780
You need to help Her Majesty
to handle the government affairs.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.860
Doesn't the Crown Princess
have an internship period?

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.540
If I have to handle
so much work in the beginning,

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.660
I will be stressed out.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.340
When the Crown Princess paraded on the street,
she took off her clothes. She disregarded...

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:38.860
Is this an official document?

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.380
This is a tabloid.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.100
All are nonsense.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.260
If you feel angry, please don't read it.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.220
No.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.980
Young Master. Listen carefully.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.820
When the Crown Princess paraded on the street,
she took off her clothes.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.020
She disregarded ancestral etiquette.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.780
What she did is disgraceful

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.940
and disgusting.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.340
She even frolicked with
Young Master on the street.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.340
They chased one another,

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.100
blatantly flirting on the street.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.140
Their conducts made people annoyed.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.460
Her Highness read it so aloud

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.140
as if it had nothing to do with her.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.860
Keep your big mouth shut!

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.420
Shut up.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.780
I don't want to see you again.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.860
Bandits on the Weimeng Mountain
often harass traveling merchants.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:53.380
the Crown Princess should lead
the City Guards to suppress bandits.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.820
What is this about?

00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.620
If you want, you can go there. I won't do it.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.220
This is my room.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.820
You should leave.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.260
This is the soup that I sent to the Crown Princess.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.260
Why has it been sent back?

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.260
Her Highness said that

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.980
your soup tastes awful.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.580
She wanted you to drink it yourself.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.980
Young Master. Don't be angry.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:52.540
Am I angry?

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.100
It is she who is angry with me.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.260
I don't dare to be angry with her.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.380
Bai Ji.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.100
Do you think that I am angry?

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.060
Young Master.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.580
You have read a lot of books
on the art of war since childhood.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.100
You know a lot of strategies.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.860
Is there any strategy that

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.060
you can use to tackle Her Highness?

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.700
This is not about war.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.140
Young Master.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.380
I have heard that

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.140
if a couple has disputes,

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.820
one side should not talk first
to the other side.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.860
The one who talks first is the loser.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.300
I have a strategy.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.660
You should ignore her.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.300
Are you a spy sent by Pei Heng?

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.020
You misunderstood me.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.300
In the past, if someone offended you,

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.100
you would do the same thing

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.060
to that person.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.900
You have always been determined.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.500
But when it comes to Her Highness,

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.860
you look indecisive.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.420
Pay somebody back

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.700
in his own coin.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.020
I have an idea. Bai Ji.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.740
Listen to me.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.180
Will it work?

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.380
Let us have a try.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:35.340
Hurry up.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.060
Yes.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.660
I shouldn't tear your dress

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.140
during the parade.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.260
Now, you can tear my dress.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.220
When you walk, my dress will be stripped off.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.020
You...

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.220
I will do what you said.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.380
You are boring.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.780
Your Highness. Minister Pei is coming.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.500
Chen Qianqian. Stop.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.620
Qianqian. What are you doing?

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.340
Pei Heng.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.220
I was playing a game with my wife.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.620
Please don't laugh at me.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.100
Young Master Han is really

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.820
different from the men of Huayuan City.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.100
Since you are in Huayuan City now,

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.820
you should get rid of

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.220
the bad habits of the men of Huayuan City.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.060
I...

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.660
(Men Virtues)
Young Master Han

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.940
should read this book carefully.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.060
Yes. Read it carefully.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:24.940
(Men Virtues)

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.220
Ok. I will read it.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.460
Pei Heng.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.140
You've come just at the right moment.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.180
I have received a lot of official documents

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.540
and I don't know how to handle them.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.660
If you have time,

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.620
can you come here to help me
to handle government affairs?

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.540
In Huayuan City, women are rulers.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.900
It is not suitable for men
to interfere in government affairs.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:40.700
It doesn't matter.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.820
You're not an outsider.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:42.700
Come on.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.940
Handling official documents is not difficult.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.460
Young Master has been doing it
since childhood.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.220
Has Pei Heng left?

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.020
No.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.900
There are just two of them in the room.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.820
What do they have to talk about?

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.820
Recently, Criminal Minister judged

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.500
a case of domestic violence crime
committed by a blacksmith.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.300
Tie family.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.020
A blacksmith from Jiang family.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.260
The housewife often beat
her husband violently.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.780
The husband sued for divorce
many times but failed.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.660
He eventually couldn't stand it anymore
and beat his wife violently.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:45.100
His wife was shocked.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.340
She couldn't accept the reality
of being beaten.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.780
According to the law of Huayuan City,

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.460
it is judged

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.460
that the husband shall
be torn apart by five horses.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.620
What is that?

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.940
Men and women are so unequal.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.020
Why are men so vulnerable

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.700
in marriage?

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.700
In Huayuan City,

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.420
according to ancestral precepts,

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.980
men should be obedient
and obey virtue ethics.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.460
If a man beats his wife,

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.020
he commits a severe crime.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.180
But that was too much.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.380
Men and women should respect each other

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.260
in marriage life.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.660
Apart from that, men should have

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.540
the same social status as you.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.820
They shouldn't be treated differently
because of gender.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.260
As for me,

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.140
I am just an exceptional case.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.260
My status depends on the fame of my mother

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.060
the late Minister Pei,

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.700
the affection from Her Majesty,

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.540
and the marriage contract with you.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.220
No. No.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.580
Don't think in that way.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.540
It is because of your talent

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.540
that you became the first
male minister in Huayuan City.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:54.780
In my mind,

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.460
you are a true man.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.580
You have talent but don't show off.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.660
You treat people with gentleness
and deal things with good sense.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.100
Besides, you are handsome.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.500
I must say that you are a male god.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.500
Male god?

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.340
Male god?

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.620
How should I explain it?

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.260
It is like...

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.020
When people meet you

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.260
and see you,

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.740
they will like you unconsciously.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.220
What's wrong? Why are you shy?

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.380
Thank Your Highness for your affection.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.660
No. No. Pei Heng.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.660
You misunderstood me.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.500
I didn't mean that.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.540
The like I just said

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.700
is not the like

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.580
that you think.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.540
The like that you think...

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.420
Qianqian.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.020
You don't have to explain.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.220
I know.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.660
You don't know.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.420
Young Master. What's wrong with you?

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.940
Does your heart disease recur?

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:10.700
I feel a little uncomfortable.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:13.060
It's OK.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.980
I just asked Her Highness.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.980
I was told that there are
a lot of government affairs.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.860
They have been working till now.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.420
the Crown Princess is afraid
that it is too late for Minister Pei

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.300
to go home,

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.220
so she asked servants

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.620
to arrange accommodation for him.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.580
It turns out that I was busy for nothing.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.580
I helped her to be the Crown Princess.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.660
She never thanked me for that.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.620
Besides, Pei Heng also found
an excuse to approach Qianqian.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.420
Young Master.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.020
Isn't it like bringing a wolf into the house?

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.780
Don't blame me for using some strategies.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.220
Suppressing bandits in Weimeng Mountain

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.580
(City Owner's Mansion)
should be under Crown Princess's charge.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.140
the Crown Princess just took office.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.060
It is time for her to make some achievements.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.300
But Her highness has lost all her Kung Fu.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.380
I am afraid that it's dangerous
for her to lead the army.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.580
I think

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.380
we had better send the Second Princess
to Weimeng Mountain.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.420
In that case, the Crown Princess can go
with Young Master Han.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.220
Young Master Han
is highly skilled in Kung Fu.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.980
He is capable enough to protect Her Highness.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.740
Then, they will quarrel all the way

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:16.860
to Weimeng Mountain.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.180
Do you think the parade case

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.380
is not disgraceful enough?

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.300
It is not strange that
a couple would quarrel.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.700
Maybe by this chance

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.140
they will experience some things together.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.260
Their relationship will
become more harmonious.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.980
Your Majesty. What do you think?

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.140
Qianqian should really gain some experience.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.580
Sangqi.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.220
Order the Crown Princess

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.220
to suppress bandits in Weimeng Mountain.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.740
Young Master Han shall go with her.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.540
Yes.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.940
You're wise, Your Majesty.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.900
Do I have to go there?

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.460
We will appreciate Your Highness' hard work.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.820
Please go to Weimeng Mountain
with Young Master.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.780
Your Highness. What are you doing?

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.940
I won't go there.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.020
Why?

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.780
I will go with you.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.620
You don't have to worry about anything.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.220
Think of it as a trip
to the mountains and rivers.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.340
I have no experience in war.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.300
Besides, if anything goes wrong,

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.460
civilians at the foot of
Weimeng Mountain will suffer.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.060
Such an important mission
should be carried out by Chuchu.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.860
She should lead the army to suppress bandits.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.300
Then she would win a great fame.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.020
It seems that Her Highness

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.220
just wants to handle official documents
with Minister Pei.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.340
Don't talk nonsense, even though it is true.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.580
It seems that Your Highness
only cares about Minister Pei.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.420
Weimeng Mountain is far away.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.260
Aren't you afraid that
I will meet some lady on the road

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.380
and will not come back?

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.980
Do you think you are capable of that?

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.700
I, Chen Xiaoqian,

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.700
got stuck in my screenplay.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.620
I only have two missions.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.020
First, survive.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.300
Second, bring Han Shuo and Chuchu together

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.780
to wrap up the story.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.500
I think I would not die soon.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.300
There is only one thing left.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.820
I can accept the mission to suppress bandits,

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.500
but I need to bring a person with me.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.500
No.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.420
Chuchu.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.340
By the order of Her Majesty,

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.340
all the people in the city
shall follow the order of Your Highness.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.260
Zi Rui. Ask Chuchu to go with us.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.260
Yes.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.380
Good evening, Young Master.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.740
You summoned me at late night.
What is the matter that is so urgent?

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.900
the Crown Princess will go to Weimeng Mountain
to suppress bandits.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.020
Han Shuo will go with Her Highness.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:51.780
Do you think

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.500
he can take care of Qianqian?

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.780
Do you mean

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.380
that I should go with them?

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.140
You grew up in Pei's Mansion

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:05.660
and have been an attendant
of me for many years.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.580
You manage affairs of the mansion

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.460
in an orderly way.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.340
You are most thoughtful and considerate.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.220
So I only trust you.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:16.940
Please don't worry, Young Master.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.180
I will stay with Her Highness

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.460
and take good care of her.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.900
Wine pots, tea cups, wine...

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.340
Zi Rui.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.380
Zi Rui.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:34.620
Where are my wine pots, tea cups,

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:35.740
and the two-flavored hot pot,

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.300
and hot pot seasoning?

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.460
I have brought them.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.060
Really?

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:39.700
You see.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.780
All is put inside.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.140
Cover it.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.100
OK. One more thing.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.420
Twenty sets of underclothes,

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.500
twenty sets of garments,

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.580
three mantles,

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.020
and my favorite

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.660
jewelry and food.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.740
All should be brought with us.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.860
All is ready. You see.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.300
The boxes are all full.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.140
They are full.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.380
We are supposed to suppress bandits.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:04.820
We are not moving house.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.580
You nearly have emptied Yueli Mansion.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.260
We should be prepared in case of need.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.460
I am here.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:10.940
You don't need to worry.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.780
It is you who don't need to worry.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:16.860
During this bandit suppression,

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.220
I will arrange everything

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.140
for Chuchu and you.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.780
What are you laughing at?

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.220
You seem very happy to
fight bandits with me.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:26.620
Of course.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.860
I will fight bandits with
Young Master and Chuchu.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.220
We are sure to win and return home.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:31.620
Don't worry.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.180
I won't let you waste a trip.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.620
Your Highness.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.980
Knowing that you'll go to Weimeng Mountain
to suppress bandits,

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:38.900
Minister Pei came to see you off.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:39.900
He arrived with an attendant

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.060
and said that he would send him to you.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:41.500
OK.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.540
No.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.500
He has already arrived.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.700
Shouldn't we see him?

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:52.700
Ask them to come in.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.580
One, three, one, eight,

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.420
three, two...

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.340
Weimeng Mountain is far away.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.020
This trip will take two to three months.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.620
Please don't worry.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.300
I will take care of myself.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.900
I will accompany Qianqian along the way.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.860
There is nothing for you to worry about.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.780
Why do you want to send an attendant to us?

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.460
Please don't laugh at me.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.180
This attendant

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.900
is delicate and considerate
with a good temper.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.300
He serves people

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.140
better than men in Xuanhu City.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.700
I believe you will also like him.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:52.820
You are so generous.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.940
Just an attendant.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.300
I am willing to give up him.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.220
You are willing to give up your attendant,

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.900
but I am not willing to give up my wife.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.700
I will take care of Qianqian.

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.020
Strange! It feels like a domestic dispute.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.420
Pei Heng, well...

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.020
I really appreciate your kindness,

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.620
but I will not accept the attendant.

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.580
Because I already have

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.060
Han Shuo, Zi Rui,

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.020
and Chuchu.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.340
Every person has different thoughts.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.700
It is not easy to lead such a team.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:28.940
So...

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.140
My name is Su Ziying.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.340
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.740
For the sake of our Young Master's

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.700
concern for you,

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.860
would you please accept me?

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.420
Please allow me to report to him
if we are safe and sound from time to time.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.220
She will not accept you.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.260
Minister Pei.

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.580
Before you send anything to others,

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.140
please ask them if they like it. Am I right?

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.060
Wait a moment.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.020
What's your name again?

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.820
My name is Su Ziying.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.380
Are you Yingying?

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.420
How do you know my infant name?

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.140
So he is

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.620
the new role I added

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.020
to push forward the plot.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.620
In the end, he'll become the match maker
for Chuchu and Han Shuo.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.740
I just need a talent like you.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.180
Zi Rui.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.140
What are you waiting for?

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.420
Hurry up and ask others
to pack all things up.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.980
We will depart soon.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.020
I was looking for you in wind and rain.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.900
I never expected that you would appear today.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:29.620
Let's go.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:30.420
Go.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.140
Yes.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.300
Please take care of him.

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.340
Young Master.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.700
You used a strategy

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.820
to separate Pei Heng from Her Highness,

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.980
so you can bring her with you
to suppress bandits.

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.180
I didn't expect him to take counter measures.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.180
He just seized this opportunity

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.940
and sent a spy to watch us.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.300
Why did Her Highness

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.620
fall into his trap?

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.660
It seems that I spoiled her too much.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.340
She just accepted a man without asking me.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.980
But he's just an attendant.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.380
But he is still a man.
