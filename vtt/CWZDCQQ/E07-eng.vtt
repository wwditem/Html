=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 7)

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.580
Young Master Han is loaded.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.740
We have profited.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.940
He's the hero.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.220
Of course he should be rich.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.380
But it's only the tip of the iceberg.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.980
There is more to come.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.060
What I mean is

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.020
Han Shuo is being gentle

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.620
like a kitty.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.060
A kitty wouldn't want to eat the orange.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.500
Your Highness, you're really resourceful.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.260
This way,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.460
Young Master Han will be devoted to you.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.020
Zi Rui, let's enjoy opera songs
at the tea house.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.700
Your Highness, Young Master Han said,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.860
"If the Third Princess wants
to listen to opera songs,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.460
invite the opera singers here
from the theater."

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.220
Invite them here?

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.300
"If the Third Princess wants to eat dessert,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.500
ask a restaurant to make dessert
and send it here."

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.140
Send it here?

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.260
"If the Third Princess wants
to stroll on the streets,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.300
bring all the jugglers and stands in the city

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.540
to the mansion."

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.220
In summary,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.460
stop the Third Princess from leaving the mansion.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.380
Stop me from leaving the mansion?

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.300
He wants to confine me to the mansion.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.020
Young Master Han is
supporting the family, after all.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.380
It won't do.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.260
Even my mother wouldn't
confine me to the mansion

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.180
and stop me from going out.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.300
Han Shuo wants to confine me?

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.460
Not gonna happen.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.060
He wants to trap me.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.820
Try it.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.500
Your Highness, something seems wrong.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.980
It's her. It's her.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.420
Do you sense a surge of hostility?

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.100
Now I know why Han Shuo

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.180
has been keeping me from leaving the mansion.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.740
It's her, Chen Qianqian.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.660
She destroyed our Dragon Bone.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.500
Feudalistic superstition can cause
great harm. Zi Rui.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.620
She destroyed our Dragon Bone.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.940
Hit her! Hit her!

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.020
Run. Run.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.260
Hit her! Hit her! Hit her!

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.900
The revised paragraph

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.740
is a stroke of genius.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.940
A desperate situation turned around.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.900
I truly feel humbled.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.980
The orange's friendly gesture
is precious and touching.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.060
The banana should be too ashamed

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.980
to ever attempt to harm the orange again.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.380
Moreover,

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.900
the orange stepped out of the fight
for succeeding the City Owner,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.260
which gave way to the apple.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.580
It's killing three birds with one stone.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.780
No one died.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.860
All problems have been solved.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.260
Brilliant. Brilliant.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.660
Don't you think

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.100
the orange is living

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.940
in a hostile environment?

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.740
Your Highness,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.180
Great people

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.380
are always starved,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.780
poverty-stricken and exhausted

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.220
before finding happiness.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.020
Yeah.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.540
Besides, seeing how smart you are,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.420
the orange won't be stuck

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.060
in the difficult situation

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.260
for too long.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.300
But the orange laid its hands

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.900
on the city's treasure.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.380
Now the people are indignant.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.660
I'm afraid the tension
won't ease in a short time.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.420
Can you please offer me some suggestions

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.700
so I can improve the situation a little?

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.860
Unless

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.460
another treasure appears,

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.420
otherwise...

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.340
The idea of another treasure sounds good.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.140
How often does a treasure appear?

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.300
Where can I find a treasure?

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.660
It won't take long.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.820
Just wait for over a thousand years.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.980
Leave everything

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.780
to time.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.900
This is my home.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.660
No matter what happens,
I should be allowed to go home.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.420
They think I can't do anything?

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.740
Even a clay doll can have a fit.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.740
Just because I'm not the Third Princess,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.220
they think they can pick on me at will?

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.060
Chen Qianqian!

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.780
You jerk! Pig's ear!

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.980
How dare you steal the Dragon Bone
and bring bad luck to the city?

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.620
What made you so bold?

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.740
You had indulged in dissipation
and you had been tyrannical.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.380
How dare you bring disaster to the people?

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.780
Aren't you afraid of punishment from heaven?

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.580
Who is she?

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.220
You... You... I'm going to drag you out here

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.740
and beat you up.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.260
I'll beat you up.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.260
Don't look at me. I'm shy. Don't look at me.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.780
I'll beat you up!

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.220
I'll beat you up!

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.460
She is Chen Qianqian!

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.860
Hit her! Hit her! Hit her!

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.940
They blame me.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.220
People block the door of Yueli Mansion.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.820
They attack the Third Princess
whenever they see her.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.700
In the end, the Third Princess went back home

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.980
by pretending to be a passerby

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.900
who scolded herself.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.540
She deserved it.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.140
She had the nerve

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.700
to destroy the Dragon Bone for her own use.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.300
She acted against the people's will.
She's definitely going to be punished.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.100
Bad news. Bad news.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.980
My lady,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.100
the Dragon Bone has shown its presence
and imposed punishment.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.980
Really? What happened to Chen Qianqian?

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.100
Lightning suddenly struck.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.900
Our mine has exploded.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:07:59.900
What?!

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.380
Our mine has exploded.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.220
Whose mine has exploded?

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.100
Ours.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.980
Our what has exploded?

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.980
Mine.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.820
Say it again.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.740
What happened to our mine?

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.100
It has exploded, my lady.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.580
Lightning has caused our mine to explode.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.620
Explode. Explode. Explode.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.220
Our mine has exploded?

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.740
My lady, please make a decision right now.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.820
Chen Qianqian,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.380
you jinx!

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.900
Heaven meant to punish you,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.580
but lightning struck the wrong person's asset.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.500
She has got her share of bad luck.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.620
She always paraded her mine.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:36.900
Lightning struck it.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.620
Just because she was Huayuan City's moneybag,

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.020
she tended to pick on you,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.420
she tended to abuse her power.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.460
Now I'd like to see her act tough.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.980
I'm here waiting for her.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.460
She likes to pick on me, doesn't she?

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.940
Fine. Feel free to come at me.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.980
Your Highness.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.540
Your Highness, I have bad news.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.060
More and more people
have come to block the door.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.580
They are going to barge into this place.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.020
Investigation shows the mine disaster
wasn't caused by humans.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.540
We should appease the families

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.460
of the trapped miner properly.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.460
By the way,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.940
how is the rescue operation going?

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.660
The only escape for the trapped miners

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.940
has been blocked by stones.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.500
According to informed citizens,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.660
over 100 miners

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.940
are trapped under the rear hill,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.660
not far from the earth's surface.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.500
If we use explosives to blast the rock,

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.020
we should be able to rescue the miners

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.020
before the mine completely collapses.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.020
How many miners have been rescued?

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.860
We...

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.380
We haven't started the rescue operation yet.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.180
Outrageous.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.620
We are talking about over 100 lives.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.660
Are you expecting me to rescue them personally?

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.540
Your Majesty, please calm down.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.980
It's not our intention to delay rescuing them.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.020
However...

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.100
However, the mine's rear hill

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.260
is connected to Huayuan's fortune lode.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.860
If we use explosives,

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.180
the fortune lode will be affected.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.700
We can't commit

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.780
such a sin, Your Majesty.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.180
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.420
Huayuan has just lost the Dragon Bone.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.340
It must not lose the fortune lode.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.460
A petition?

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:18.860
Your Majesty,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.020
it's a petition submitted
jointly by the citizens.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.540
Ten thousand citizens have petitioned for...

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.660
Petitioned for what?

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.220
Petitioned for...

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.740
They have petitioned for Chen Qianqian's death
to quell heaven's wrath.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.340
How dare you!

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.380
Please sentence Chen Qianqian to death
in order to quell heaven's wrath.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.780
Your Highness.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.100
Your Highness, please take pity on us.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.540
Save my son.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.220
And my family.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.940
All of them are buried in the mine.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.380
I don't know if they are alive or dead.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.100
Over 100 lives

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.620
depend on you.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.300
They depend on you.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.620
Is there anything I can do?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.140
Your Highness, I'm begging you,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.220
please sacrifice yourself.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.580
Offer yourself as a sacrifice
to quell heaven's wrath.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.820
Please embrace death bravely, Your Highness.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.100
Please sacrifice yourself, Your Highness.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.740
Please embrace death bravely, Your Highness.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:35.180
Please embrace death bravely, Your Highness.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.420
Please sacrifice yourself, Your Highness.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.140
Chen Qianqian calls herself the "Third Princess"

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.460
for fun.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.580
But I'm the person to take the blame.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.700
I'll pay a heavy price for this.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:54.780
Please sentence Chen Qianqian to death
in order to quell heaven's wrath.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.100
You...

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.500
You are asking me to kill my child,

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.500
aren't you?

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.580
Now people are indignant.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.780
We must kill her
to assuage people's indignation.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.060
Instead of trying to convict Chen Qianqian,

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.180
we should find a way

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.580
to protect the fortune lode

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.020
and save lives.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.820
Have you got any ideas, Minister Yang?

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.460
We can put the rescue operation on hold

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.740
until the mine collapses.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.620
Then we can declare
the rescue team arrive too late,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.180
and pretend to scold the official

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.500
in charge of the rescue operation.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.260
As for the families of the victims,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.980
the government can appease them

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.740
with more financial compensation.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.740
What about Yueli Mansion?

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.340
I heard people

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.660
have surrounded Yueli Mansion.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.940
Chen Qianqian can neither enter
nor leave the mansion.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.220
She's in peril.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.340
This matter

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.420
requires your decision to settle.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.140
Please give your order, mother.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.220
What order?

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.900
The commoner Chen Qianqian laid her hands on the Dragon Bone

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.980
which incurred heaven's punishment.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.740
People have been punished for her crime.
She must not be pardoned.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.660
I'd take troops to surround Yueli Mansion

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.220
and guard her well.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.260
After the storm calms down,

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.100
she will be dealt with according to her crime.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.540
Approved.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.500
You shall take troops there immediately.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.660
Guard her well.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.340
Don't let that bastard run away.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.540
Alright. You're dismissed.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.140
Mother.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.900
I'll keep Qianqian safe.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.940
Chuchu.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.580
Qianqian has always been obedient to you.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.060
Be on your way

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.500
and don't let her run away.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.540
You must guard her well.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.980
With you watching over her,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.980
I'll feel relieved.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.340
Yes.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.380
Chuchu.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.100
Whatever happens in the future,

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.980
you must keep Qianqian safe.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.780
I won't fail you, mother.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.540
Your Majesty, it seems

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.020
you have high hopes for the Second Princess.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.580
Qianqian is hopeless.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.420
I'm taking the overall situation into account,

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.780
leaving the important task to Chuchu.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.380
I hope she'll achieve greatness

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.700
and treat Qianqian nicely.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.940
Qianqian,

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.580
you and I are the children of City Owners.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.140
We seem to be in a high position,

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.020
but we often have no choice.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.620
Don't take their words to heart.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.020
Just stay here.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.180
While I'm here,

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.020
nobody will dare to harm you.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.540
Bai Ji.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.780
Tell our people to be on standby.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.060
Yes.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.340
I know I won't die.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.860
But what about the miners in the mine?

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.220
You're still thinking for them?

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.780
Don't forget

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.940
that Huayuan's citizens

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.020
just petitioned for your sacrifice.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.420
I'm Her Majesty's daughter.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.580
I enjoyed wealth in peaceful times.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.580
I didn't do much to benefit the people.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.700
All I did was make trouble.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.980
It's normal

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.620
for them to blame me

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.820
when a disaster occurs.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.780
Mountains decide the scale of population
and water decides the degree of prosperity.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.500
This place nestles against mountains and water.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.900
It's a treasured land with great feng shui.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.660
The so-called fortune lode was created

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.860
when your ancestors settled down in this place.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.540
Their descendants built a city

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.060
around this place.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.220
Then Huayuan City gradually took form.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.220
This place has been honored as the fortune lode.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.380
It's the foundation of Huayuan City.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.980
The fortune lode is very close to the mine,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.460
because Huayuan City's economic lifeline

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.020
lies in the mining industry.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.740
Your ancestors were really far-sighted.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.380
They built the city here

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.700
to guarantee provisions for the citizens.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.100
My ancestors planned carefully,

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.020
but they didn't know they would
have an unworthy descendant like me.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.420
This place is connected to the mine.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.100
The drawing tells me

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.860
those miners are trapped

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.540
here.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.660
Before entering the cave and starting to mine,

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.380
the miners would use pillars
to secure the rocks in the cave,

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.300
preventing the mine from collapsing.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.820
From we are seeing now,

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.700
only half of the mountain has collapsed,

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.460
which means half of the wooden pillars

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.100
are still supporting the cave.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.420
It's very likely that those people in the mine

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.340
will come out alive.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.700
The pillars in the mine

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.060
might not hold for long.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.220
Then what are we waiting for?
Go and rescue them now.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.740
Couldn't my mother and the others
find a way out of this?

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.340
I have an idea.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.020
The fortune lode in the rear can be...

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:17.860
Exploded.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.700
Right.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.140
You think so too?

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.300
Yes.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.500
This way, we can open up a path

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.980
for them to escape.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.180
What's on your mind?

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.660
I'm wondering

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.540
who would commit the monstrous crime

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.500
of blowing up the fortune lode.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.420
After I stewed the Dragon Bone,

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.060
a bunch of people begged me to die.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.180
Blowing up the fortune lode is also a grave crime
that will result in capital punishment.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.180
I know.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.340
Only one person can do this.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.340
The heroine.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.900
The heroine can do this for sure.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:04.940
Qianqian.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.980
Make way.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.140
Couldn't she see that I want to help her?

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.340
Young Master, you don't have to help her.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.980
It's unlikely for the miners to return alive.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.180
The people will blame Her Majesty
for her incompetence.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.580
The more turbulent Huayuan City is,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.540
the more advantages Xuanhu City has.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.820
If you solve the problem,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.020
you will fall into an awkward situation.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.460
I'm afraid that the people

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.340
will blame Qianqian for this.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.220
But whatever.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.940
She has thought of blowing up the fortune lode.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.700
As long as she can get out of her predicament,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.940
it doesn't matter who will
blow up the fortune lode.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.020
If the Third Princess will look
for Minister Pei's help,

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.260
will you be as open-minded as you are now?

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.420
Sure.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.740
Your Highness, where are you going?

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.620
I'm going to Chuchu.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.060
Please don't make things difficult for us.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.340
The Second Princess said

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.540
you must not leave the mansion.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.300
But I will.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.180
Stop.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.700
Qianqian, you are so willful.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.060
We've given you everything you wanted
since you were little.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.260
Our pampering has made you what you are now,

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.620
a person who respects nothing.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.260
Chuchu,

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.780
we have an emergency. No time to dawdle.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.020
Take your troops to the mine

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.980
and save over 100 miners.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.260
Go now or it'll be too late.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.740
We are talking about over 100 miners.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.660
Other people can show no care,

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.300
but you can't. You are the heroine...

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.540
I mean... the princess.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.100
It's a good opportunity for you
to win a reputation.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.540
At this time,

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.340
you're still thinking about those miners.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.620
Just blow up the fortune lode

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.060
and you'll be able to rescue all the miners.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.780
Blow up the fortune lode?

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.100
You want me to end up

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.580
like you?

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.100
Be deposed by our mother.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.660
Lose my princess's title.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.100
Let people reproach me
and petition for my sacrifice?

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.420
That's different.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.660
I stole the Dragon Bone
to satisfy my selfish desire.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.620
You won't do the same thing.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.580
If you blow up the fortune lode,

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.620
our mother will flare up for a moment,

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.820
but you will save the people

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:20.900
and win people's hearts.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.460
People's hearts are more important

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.580
than mother's mood.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.940
For you,

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.580
people's hearts are no doubt more important.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.980
Because you are already loved by mother.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.900
You know what,

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.900
when I was fighting in other places

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.300
and facing danger,

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.300
mother stayed by your bed

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.420
and took no interest in my situation.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.260
Just then,

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.020
she finally smiled at me.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.500
Do you know why?

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.180
Because I asked to guard you with troops.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.540
Mother only cares about you.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.620
But again and again, you have done things

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.340
to place her in a dilemma.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.340
Chuchu.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.340
Has it ever occurred to you

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.500
that if I had been the person
who stole the Dragon Bone,

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.020
I might have

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.020
died now?

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.540
That's not true, Chuchu.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.780
You would have followed heaven's will
if you had stolen the Dragon Bone.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.660
And I only stole the Dragon Bone to...

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.260
Never mind.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.820
... save my life.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.820
I'll just guard you well

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.700
and save myself from our mother's reprimand.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.140
Chuchu.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.260
You'll be the future City Owner.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.180
How can you give up over 100 lives

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.060
to avoid mother's reprimand?

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.140
Is your reputation as a princess

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.860
more important than over 100 lives?

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.740
I can't destroy the fortune lode for them.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.980
For those miners,

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.180
sacrificing themselves for Huayuan City

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.420
is their privilege

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.100
as Huayuan's citizens.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.500
Qianqian, I hope

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.700
you'll consider others more from now on.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.420
Keep your nose clean.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.700
If you hadn't stolen the Dragon Bone,

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.660
maybe mother would have ordered people

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.900
to blow up the fortune lode

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.260
and rescue the miners.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:10.940
Escort her back to her room.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.020
But if I had behaved,

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.540
I might have died already.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.300
Qianqian,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.620
you have failed to get Chuchu's help.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.340
Try to seek help from someone else.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.460
Someone else?

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.540
Who can help me now?

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.300
Try to rely on men.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.620
Men?

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.980
Men.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.380
You mean...

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.420
Find Pei Heng.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.100
Your Highness.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:09.780
Your Highness.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.660
I've been told that you're ill.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:12.820
What's the problem?

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.460
Why didn't you have Princess Royal
diagnose you?

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.340
No.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.620
I'm not ill. I lied to you.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.900
I have invited you here today
to ask for a favor.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:21.620
I want to leave the mansion.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.020
Since you don't want to stay here,

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.460
I'll take you out.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.100
I knew you would help me.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.580
She would rather ask Pei Heng
for help than ask me.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.620
Pei Heng can't carry heavy loads.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.100
He has no troop to command.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.220
What can he do?

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.260
Young Master,

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.340
you said as long as the Third Princess
could get out of her predicament,

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.060
it didn't matter who would
blow up the fortune lode.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.100
It didn't matter?

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.700
I'd like to see

00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.780
how can they explode the fortune lode

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.580
without my help.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.420
(Yueli Mansion)

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.980
Your Highness.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.420
What are you...

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.380
I heard Qianqian is ill.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.100
I told the kitchen staff
to cook her favorite food.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.660
Your Highness,

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.820
the Third Princess has gone to bed.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.980
It's inconvenient for her to meet you now.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.180
Maybe you should leave.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.740
What? But Minister Pei just left.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.780
She is already in bed now?

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.260
Yeah. The Third Princess is feeling dizzy.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.340
I think she has gone to bed.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.220
She must be angry with me.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.820
Qianqian,

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.460
I know my harsh words have hurt your feelings.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.180
Don't be mad.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.300
I was just having a fit.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.740
I'm keeping you indoors for your own good.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.420
The outside world is turbulent.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.980
Everyone is looking to condemn you.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.700
Mother and I have no choice

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.260
but to make such an unfortunate decision.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.260
Stop being mad.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.540
Have some food.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:20.980
Qianqian.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.940
Your Highness, uh...

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.620
Your Highness, spare me.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.020
You are a servant from Pei Heng's mansion.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.380
So dizzy.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.740
What a cunning escape plan.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.140
Didn't she think of my situation
before running away?

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.780
I'm finally out.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.780
Your mansion has become a target
of public criticism.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.700
Come with me to my mansion.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.220
Nobody will dare to harm you there.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.220
No. I must go to the mine.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.780
You asked me to take you out,

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.820
so you could rescue those miners?

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.060
Yes.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:05.740
How are you going to rescue them?

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.060
Blow up the fortune lode.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.660
Have you thought of the consequences?

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.660
Now the officials,

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.100
peddlers and dogsbodies

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.100
wish to sacrifice you to assuage
the people's indignation.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.540
If you blow up the fortune lode,

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.180
things will get worse.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.300
Even Her Majesty might not
be able to save you,

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.140
not to mention me.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.380
But...

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.460
Success hinges on human efforts.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.500
If you never try, you'll never know.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.580
We are talking about over 100 lives, after all.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.340
It's nothing to joke about.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.340
But the miners

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.300
are all men.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.140
Men and women

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.140
aren't different in essence.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.500
They are all human lives.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.140
I didn't know you held this kind of opinion.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.900
Please turn into that alley ahead.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.100
Pei Heng.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.900
Zi Rui and I agreed to meet at the mine.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.300
I have to rush there.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.620
Qianqian.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.500
I'm going with you.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.380
I can't let you dive into danger alone.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.380
No need, Pei Heng.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.060
I can't get you in trouble.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.700
I'm already in trouble, so I'm not afraid.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.940
But you should stay out of it.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.740
Got to go. Thank you.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.860
Qianqian. Qianqian.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:31.700
I've failed you.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.220
Qianqian has run away.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.380
You...

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:41.740
Why didn't you dodge?

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.940
What? The Third Princess has gone to the mine?

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.540
But...

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.260
Come on. I'm going to the mine.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.140
Mother.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.860
Does mother

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.940
only care about Qianqian?

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.460
Your Highness.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.620
What should we do now?

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.740
Please give an order.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.220
Inform the City Guards

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.900
to come with me to Lin's mine.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.700
Yes.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.500
Are our people in place?

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.980
Our people are in place,

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.940
making sure the Third Princess won't be harmed.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.140
But Young Master,

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.780
Minister Pei will have people

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.300
help the Third Princess rescue the miners.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.780
Why are we waiting here?

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:22.940
Pei Heng can't help Qianqian.

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.580
What does a person need

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.620
to blow up the fortune lode?

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.780
The fortune lode.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:30.900
What else?

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.740
Explosives.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.140
She will beg me eventually.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.300
Xuanhu City

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.380
uses black stones to make explosives.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.420
Huayuan City uses black stones
to make fireworks.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.300
What's the use of fireworks?

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.060
Have you got everything ready?

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:53.740
I have got everything ready.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.140
Good.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.340
We have no explosives.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.940
We have no explosives?

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.460
How am I going to blow up
the fortune lode without explosives?

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.980
Can I use you to blow it up?

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.620
Should I use you to blow it up?

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.140
Huayuan City has always
produced nothing but fireworks.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.060
Only Xuanhu City produces explosives.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.820
Right. Han Shuo nearly destroyed Huayuan

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.140
with explosives in the later stages.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:23.860
Come on.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.020
Who owns explosives in Huayuan City?

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.140
Who?

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.700
The Second Princess.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.900
The Second Princess is also
the Minister of Defense.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.300
She definitely owns explosives.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.340
If Chuchu sees me,

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.140
she'll catch me and send me back to the mansion
before I could ask her for explosives.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.900
Minister Pei.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.020
Minister Pei is the only son
of the late Minister of Defense Pei.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.860
If he asks the City Guards for help,
they will do him a favor.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.260
Minister Pei never intervenes

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.580
in the City Guards' affairs.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:49.820
I can't trouble him.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.500
Lin Qi.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.500
She is the richest person in Huayuan City.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.420
She can purchase explosives at a high price.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.620
Yeah.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.820
Lin Qi can spend a lot of money

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.620
on explosives to blow up her own mine.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.340
Between Lin Qi and you,

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.100
one of you must have been brain-damaged.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.420
What's wrong with them?

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.300
They even considered seeking Lin Qi's help.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.500
You simply never crossed their minds.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:13.660
This is...

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.580
an emergency.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.500
It's inevitable for them to neglect the obvious.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.180
I'm going to kick you to death.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.780
No. Give me more time to think.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.380
Who is there?

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.100
A bamboo tube.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.380
Fireworks.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.540
I got it!

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.220
Finally.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.500
The owner of the grocery shop.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.580
Han Shuo, what brought you here?

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.820
I'm just passing by.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.940
We heard

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.260
what you said.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.780
You are really thoughtful.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.940
You have considered seeking help
from everyone in Huayuan City.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.780
But I don't know anyone

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.180
who can give me explosives.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.180
Our Young Master is standing right before you.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.100
Can't you see?

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.420
I'll be in the toilet.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:29.860
Han Shuo.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.820
Right. Xuanhu City produces explosives.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.500
But will you help me?

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.780
We are on different sides.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.180
I understand your doubts.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.460
But this is a life-and-death matter.
It's an emergency.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.540
I won't gamble on human lives.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.460
A life-and-death matter?

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.460
It turns out Han Shuo

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.140
isn't as cold and heartless as I thought.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.060
This is what a hero should look like.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.580
What is a hero?

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.820
It's like the male lead of a story.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.580
Then can the hero

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.660
win the beauty's heart?

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.380
He usually can as long as he doesn't die.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.380
Fortunately,

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.540
my heart disease has been cured by you.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.220
Don't worry.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.860
I have planted the explosives.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.260
The explosives can be detonated anytime.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:25.820
It's dangerous.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:26.540
Let me go.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.300
No. I should go.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.220
You can't go.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.180
You are the precious Third Princess.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.500
You'll regain your title sooner or later.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:34.460
You had better be careful.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.340
I'll go in your stead.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:36.660
No.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.900
You are the beloved son
of the owner of Xuanhu City.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.740
You'll achieve greatness in the future.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.500
How can you take such a risk for me?

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.500
Of course I should go.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.220
I said I'd let no harm come to you.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.420
It's so dangerous.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.580
I should go.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.940
Young Master, you don't know

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.540
how important you are to me.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.620
If anything happens to you,
the whole situation will change.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.820
No. You can't go. I'll go.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.300
But without you,

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.020
my life would have no meaning.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:05.660
Then...

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.340
Then we can go together.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:08.660
Okay.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.140
Qianqian.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.100
Have I blown the right structure?

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.940
Step back.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:25.940
Step back further.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.060
What is the meaning of this?

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.140
You sprinkled dust

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.700
on the Third Princess.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.500
Come on.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:35.860
Qianqian.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.580
Hurry.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.380
Chen Qianqian!

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.460
Isn't this Lin Qi?

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.580
Are you here to help? Let's do it together.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:47.620
Chen Qianqian,

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.180
you not only disbanded
my Music and Dance Academy,

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.900
but also blew up my black stone mine.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:51.900
I even blew up the fortune lode.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.900
Who cares about your mine?

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.780
How funny.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.100
I'll teach you a lesson today!

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:55.900
Get her!

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.060
Stop. Stop.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.660
You're defending her again?

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:02.700
Your people

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.580
are no match for my guards.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:05.660
Leave.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.020
Stop!

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.700
Arrest the criminal

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.940
who destroyed the fortune lode!

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.620
Your Highness,

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.780
you also want to capture Qianqian?

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.700
Minister Pei,

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:24.940
I'm afraid your guards

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.860
are no match for the City Guards.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:30.540
Arrest her.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.620
Stop!

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.300
Stop!

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.620
I pay respect to you, Your Majesty.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.500
What,

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:49.380
are you going to arrest

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.060
your younger sister as if she is a criminal?

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.260
Chen Qianqian blew up the fortune lode.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.420
She must not be exempted from punishment.

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.700
Please punish her, Mother.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.300
Outrageous!

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:57.900
How can you?

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.180
How dare you?

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:00.300
Don't worry.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.460
My people have always been around.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.060
I will keep you safe.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.980
How many troops have you
deployed here secretly?

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.420
The whole crew must be here.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.500
This must be a big scene. Gosh.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.780
I have never written such a costly scene.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.180
We have found them! We have found them!

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.660
Come and rescue them!

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.380
Coming!

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.740
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.460
Here. Be careful.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:57.860
Here.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.060
Be careful. Be careful.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.220
Come on. Sit down.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:17.780
Is anyone left down there?

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.780
No. No one.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.660
Everyone has been taken out.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.220
Qianqian.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.580
Are you okay?

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.140
You are...

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.620
The Third... Third Princess.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.860
How come you...

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.500
The Third Princess saved you.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:38.540
The Third Princess.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.460
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:47.180
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.100
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.620
No! The fortune lode is gone!

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.380
Your Majesty.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.900
Chen Qianqian destroyed the Dragon Bone
for her selfish interests earlier.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.300
Now she blown up the fortune lode
without permission.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.660
Huayuan City's long-standing business

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.100
has been ruined by her.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.860
Your Majesty, please sentence Chen Qianqian to death.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.060
Your Majesty.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.260
The Dragon Bone and fortune lode

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.220
have decided Huayuan City's fate
for about a thousand years.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.540
Chen Qianqian must die,

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.620
unless Huayuan City obtains another treasure.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.940
How dare you!

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.500
Your Majesty, please listen to the citizens.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.860
Your Majesty, please sentence Chen Qianqian to death.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.540
Your Majesty, please sentence Chen Qianqian to death.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.060
Your Majesty, please sentence Chen Qianqian to death.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.540
Your Majesty.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.500
please pardon the Third Princess.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.260
The Third Princess is kind-hearted.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.700
She loves people
as if they are her children.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.020
Your Majesty.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:55.620
Please pardon the Third Princess.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.220
Chen Qianqian must not
be exempted from punishment,

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.020
unless another treasure shows up

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.340
to fill in for the lost Dragon Bone
and fortune lode.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.100
Otherwise, our ancestors

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.380
won't rest in peace.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.540
You have me.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.220
Don't be afraid.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.100
For unlucky people,

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.620
everything can be a torment.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.580
But for lucky people,

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.300
things can always take a turn for the better.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.100
Lin Qi,

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.220
look what this is.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:53.940
The fire box.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.340
Petroleum! Petroleum!

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:03.940
Petroleum!

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.300
It's petroleum.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.300
Petroleum!

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.740
It's true that the black stone mine
is the foundation of Huayuan City.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.020
But petroleum

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.900
is even more precious than the black stone mine.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:13.500
Yes.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.300
Petroleum is also known as black water.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.420
One cubic meter of black water is
worth more than one dou of gold.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.380
From what we are seeing now,

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.340
enormous wealth is buried

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.620
under the fortune lode.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.660
The fact that the Third Princess risked her life
to save the miners

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.540
has touched her ancestors.
They have bestowed this treasure on us.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.900
The Third Princess has unearthed
the black water mine.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.060
Heaven has blessed us

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.540
with the black water mine.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.860
Heaven has blessed us

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.620
with the black water mine.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.980
Heaven has blessed us

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.460
with the black water mine.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:38.900
Heaven has blessed us

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.420
with the black water mine.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.940
Heaven has blessed us

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.620
with the black water mine.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.740
Can you hear what they are calling you?

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:47.860
The Third Princess.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.660
In the past, they called you the Third Princess

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.180
to taunt you, and mostly, to tease you.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.420
But now they are calling you the Third Princess

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.140
to show submission, and mostly, to revere you.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.340
Heaven has blessed us with the black water mine.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.780
You deserve the title of the Third Princess.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.500
Heaven has blessed us

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.860
with the black water mine.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.500
It'd take more than a thousand years

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.540
for petroleum to take form.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.860
It'd take a million years.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:12.860
As they said,

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.900
time can solve every problem.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:22.460
Heaven has blessed us with the black water mine.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:27.380
(City Owner's Mansion)

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.780
Your Majesty,

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.340
the black water mine is extremely rare.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.740
I only heard of it from legends.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.580
Its value is even greater than the Dragon Bone.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.900
It'll be very conducive
to stabilizing the city

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.060
and benefiting the people.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.500
We can expect the city to prosper soon.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.500
All this

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.820
is the result of the Third Princess's
good fortune.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.900
Chen Qianqian has become a commoner.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.980
She is not the Third Princess.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.540
Her Majesty's fortune is people's fortune.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.780
Now everyone is commending the Third Princess

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.580
for blowing up the fortune lode
and saving the people.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.980
The black water mine shows our ancestors'
approval of the Third Princess.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.780
Your Majesty,

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.140
please restore the Third Princess's title

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.020
to show your benevolence and grace.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.220
Your Majesty.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.060
Alright.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.460
Minister Yang is right.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.540
Qianqian has made a great contribution.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.420
Her title shall be restored immediately.

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.380
You're wise, Your Majesty.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.620
You're wise, Your Majesty.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.860
Your Highness, what would you like to eat today?

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.060
Delicacies of all kinds.
I'll eat anything expensive.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:29.940
Yes.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.500
-Your Highness? -Your Highness!

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.020
Your Highness.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.860
Stop! Don't run.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:36.980
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.380
I have got my title back.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.060
Why are they still chasing me?

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.780
We have no guard. We must run.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.140
Han Shuo.

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.500
Wait.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.780
Your Highness, why are you running?

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.300
If I didn't run, you'd hit me.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.500
Those tomatoes are really big.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:53.220
Yeah.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.260
Your Highness, you are mistaken.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.940
These are our gifts for you.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.020
Your Highness.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.420
We are sorry for being rude
to you the other day.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.420
My eldest brother worked at Lin's mine.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.940
When I heard of the mine disaster,

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.180
I thought I would never see him again.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.700
Young Master Han and you rescued him.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.500
Thank you.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.500
Yes. Yes.

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.460
It's okay. No trouble. No trouble at all.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.020
You risked your lives to save them.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.980
We can never pay you back.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:21.900
These eggs

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.980
are laid by our hens.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.700
And we grew these vegetables.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.300
All these things are for you.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.260
Let me do it.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.100
These things

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.620
are far more delicious than the delicacies.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.540
That's right.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:40.980
Thank you.
