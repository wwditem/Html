=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 22)

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.860
(Xingzi Mansion)

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.820
Your Highness, I...

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.380
Please forgive my incompetence.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.020
Lin Qi suddenly showed up

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.380
and saved Chen Qianqian.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.460
Lin Qi is still alive?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.700
Su Ziying has been captured.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.500
They've run away towards Xuanhu City.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.580
You good-for-nothings.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.060
Send guys to chase them.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.300
Make sure Chen Qianqian is killed

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.500
before they arrive at Xuanhu City.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.380
Got it.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.340
Mr. Pei.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.340
Minister Pei.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.580
You can leave.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.620
Got it.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.900
The City Owner has made
an official statement.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.740
For the common people in Huayuan City,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.940
Chen Qianqian is already dead.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.260
Now that the Princess Royal's
legs haven't been cured,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.060
you'll be the only candidate
for Crown Princess.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.860
Why do you still not let Qianqian go?

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.740
She's left Huayuan City,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.340
but what if my mother changes her mind

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.540
and allows her to come back?

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.300
Are you determined

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.700
to kill your sister who grew up with you

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.940
just for that reason?

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.740
In case your mother knows about it,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.660
I'm not sure

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.220
if I can save you again.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.540
Pei Heng,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.740
do you think

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.900
you can make indiscreet criticisms

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.100
because you interceded
with my mother on my behalf?

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.460
As for flower token,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.580
I haven't got even with you.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.980
When my mother forgives me,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.540
I'll still be

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.860
Minister of Defense of Huayuan City.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.940
I don't know

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.500
if your mother will forgive you,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.300
but don't forget

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.780
City Guards evolved from
the army of the Pei family.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.020
It's right and proper that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.460
a descendant of the Pei family
serves as Minister of Defense.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.380
It depends on if you can convince everyone.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.580
I don't think

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.060
a man can hold this position

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.460
for a long time.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.660
Are you being afraid?

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.820
I swear to God

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.740
I won't let you regret
the decision you made today.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.100
What are you doing?

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.140
I want to always look at you like this.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.260
I feel your eyes are telling me

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.740
something is wrong.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.100
Thinking of the night we spent in prison,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.500
I can't control my feelings.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.140
In...

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.620
In broad daylight, exercise self-restraint.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.620
We'll go to Xuanhu City
by way of Weimeng Mountain.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.300
Thinking of what happened
in the storage room of the inn,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.860
I can't help

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.900
feeling regretful.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.460
You... Go to Bai Ji if you regret it.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.780
Stay away from me.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.060
(The Inn)

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.020
Sir, my liquor.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.460
Waiter, liquor please.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.300
Just a second.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.980
Here it is.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.220
Fill it up.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.020
This way please.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.060
Waiter. Hurry up.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.780
Well.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.220
If Orange got married to Banana,

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.020
their kid would be

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.780
Banange?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.620
Guys!

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.460
Why are you here?

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.340
I didn't expect to see you again.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.500
Your Highness,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.780
before you left,

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.860
Young Master Han insisted
on taking us with you.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.340
We don't know why

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.500
and we don't dare to ask.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.420
Maybe he's afraid you'll feel bored,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.900
so he wants us

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.180
to divert you from boredom
by telling you stories.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.780
Congratulations,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.860
Your Highness.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.180
You've dodged open and covert attacks.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.940
You had a difficult time.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.940
I'm glad you've survived
and come to the final episode.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.300
I have to thank you
for your advice and suggestions.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.100
I did it by good fortune.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.700
As the saying goes,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.140
two heads are better than one.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.500
Actually, I wanted to see you

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.220
stay with Minister Pei.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.260
You know nothing about it.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.220
The more intense the contradiction is

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.260
between Crown Princess and Han Shuo,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.580
the more devoted they are to each other.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.620
You can't say that.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.820
Relationships are complicated.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.900
Exactly.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.980
No girl would fall in love with a man

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.620
who wanted to kill her
in the first place.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.340
Right.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.900
Who else could turn things around

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.700
like Crown Princess?

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.460
The Second Princess

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.180
was gentle at the beginning,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.140
but now she's...

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.780
You can't judge people
only by their appearance.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.860
Do you agree?

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.100
Yeah.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.420
The Second Princess became like that
because of Crown Princess.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.580
Hey. Wait.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.380
You've known everything?

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.660
Apple.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.460
Orange.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.540
Banana.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.340
No.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.940
When did you know that?

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.900
Here is the thing.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.860
At the very beginning,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.180
you wanted to fix up Banana and Apple, right?

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.820
You planned to give Apple
a chance to save Banana,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.940
so you decided to take Banana

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.660
to the Music and Dance Academy.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.020
Right.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.580
When he was bullied there,

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.700
you'd let Apple show up

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.100
at the critical moment

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.420
to save him.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.300
But that very day,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.380
you took Young Master Han
to the Music and Dance Academy

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.620
and forced him to compete
with other musicians.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.700
Um. Look.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.740
The three of us are not idiots.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.460
The clue was obvious.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.340
Right?

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.140
I admire you.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.100
Your Highness,

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.980
why do you know people around you so well?

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.780
And you know lots of little-known secrets,

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.940
like where Dragon Bone was hidden

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.580
and how Young Master Han
suffered heart disease.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.500
You often foretold things.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.580
It's like...

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.500
It's like you live inside a story

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.540
and I live outside it.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.780
Exactly.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.500
Could it be that...

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.700
...you're an immortal?

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.180
Whatever.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.260
As you like.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.260
Anyway,

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.500
it's true that Apple is Chuchu,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.980
Orange is me

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.180
and Banana is Han Shuo.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.100
I created this story.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.860
Someday,

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.940
when the three of you

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.300
enter the scripts you write,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.100
the same thing will happen to you.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.740
In this case,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.340
you created us.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.380
Don't say that.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.180
When I go back to Huayuan,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.340
I'll write a book about you

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.780
so that your name will
be remembered by posterity.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.820
Right.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.580
Sir?

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.060
Sir?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.220
Han Shuo.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.780
Hey. Han Shuo. Wait for me.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.300
Han Shuo.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.380
Han Shuo, stop running.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.900
Han Shuo.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.540
Hey. I can explain.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.540
It hurts.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.820
It hurts.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.020
On the carriage, you said

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.300
you'd be nice to me all your life.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.700
It's just a short time ago
and you already began to regret it?

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.100
If I hadn't heard your conversation,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.940
would you always hide it from me?

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.700
I planned to explain to you

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.780
after we arrive at Xuanhu City.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.780
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.340
There were a lot of things

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.460
I couldn't tell you at the beginning.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.460
You framed me on purpose for hurting Su Mu

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.500
to send me into exile.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.860
That's because I wanted
to avoid the previous ending.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.860
My mother, Lin Qi and Lu Peng...

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.740
They ended up having
a stroke or being killed,

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.660
the same way as I wrote in the script.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.380
I was afraid you'd also end up like that.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.900
But later,

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.780
my mother woke up

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.700
and Lin Qi didn't die,

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.260
so I felt relieved.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.860
I planned to explain to you,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.940
but you hated me so much at that time.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.100
You didn't want to talk to me at all.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.940
Why did you want to push
me away to Chen Chuchu?

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.540
I stopped doing that when I realized

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.860
I was into you.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.700
You even made use of my heart disease.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.700
I stole Dragon Bone

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.220
and cured you.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.260
You forged a tip-off

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.780
and asked Chen Chuchu to catch me.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.180
You already knew it long ago.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.060
I...

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.100
You designed my heart disease, right?

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.180
As I said,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.540
I cured you.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.620
It's true,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.700
but it's designed by you.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.580
Why do I bother to explain to you?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.820
What's up?

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.980
You're not mad at me anymore?

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.020
I'm just

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:41.980
so shocked.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.340
But I finally understand

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.260
why you often lied to me,

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.340
why everything I did

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.060
went against your original intention,

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.180
and why you're entirely different

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.180
from any other girl I've ever seen.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.020
I once complained that you were heartless.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.380
I couldn't guess how serious
you were about me

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.100
and I didn't know when you
were telling the truth.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.780
But at this moment, I can tell

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.260
you're into me.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.540
It's true.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.380
That's enough for me.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.420
Xiaoqian, I've finally got you.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.540
The complete you,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.100

♪...that records our own beautiful lives.♪

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.860
Screenwriter?

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.660
Just like a storyteller.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.500
From the two countries

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.380
with different systems

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.460
to every tree and bush,

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.060
all those were created by me.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.500
So, as for who they are,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.780
what they'll do

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.980
and what setbacks they'll go through...

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.220
I basically know everything.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.620
That's why I knew you wanted to kill me
as soon as I came here.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.940
That's also why I could survive that crisis.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.700
So,

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.220
actually, I'm just
a character in your script.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.740
No.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.860
At the beginning, I also thought

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.340
you were just a group
of fictional characters,

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.100
but later, I found each of you

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.460
had your own emotions.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.820
I didn't create that.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.020
You have real feelings,

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.260
just like us.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.460
How is the world you live in?

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.980
Is it like Huayuan City

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.180
or Xuanhu City?

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.660
Our world?

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.540
In our world,

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.740
as for if men or women

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.460
have the final say,

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.860
sometimes it's like Huayuan City

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.380
and sometimes like Xuanhu City.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.140
That's a subject for debate,

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.820
so I wrote this story.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.620
Is it possible

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.220
your world is also created by a screenwriter?

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.420
Maybe.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.940
A mixture of truth and falsehood.
Who can tell it clearly?

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.020
Are all screenwriters in your world

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.180
as lovely as you?

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.940
Yes, in addition,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.500
they're talented.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.100
Every screenwriter

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.620
is concentrated

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.660
when they're writing a story.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.860
Sometimes,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.420
there are some flaws in the plot.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.140
Sometimes, it's cheesy.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.780
Sometimes,

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.820
the leading roles become self-abandoners.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.660
But overall, a screenwriter loves
every character created by him or her.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.100
Sometimes, they even fall
in love with a character.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.380
Did you

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.980
fall in love with Pei Heng?

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.980
It's a different case.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.540
You're a hero.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.980
A hero

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.580
has to stay with a heroine.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.740
The male supporting role

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.020
belongs to all.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.860
Did Pei Heng know about that?

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.260
Of course not.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.740
Don't tell him.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.420
I want to be the only one

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.180
who knows about it.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.380
How does the story end?

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.260
At the end of the story,

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.860
Chuchu succeeded my mother as City Owner.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.380
The sun and the moon were up
in the sky at the same time.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.420
The gate to Heaven was wide open.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.380
I fell in asleep after I wrote that

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.740
and then I came here.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.580
So, I guess

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.060
I can't go back

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.980
until the sun and the moon are up
in the sky at the same time

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.780
and the gate to Heaven is wide open.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.580
Are you afraid

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.620
I may leave?

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.740
Of course not.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:36.940
After you leave,

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.380
I'll stay in Xuanhu City

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.740
and marry 300 concubines.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.580
I'll have a different woman every day.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.260
So, I have no time to miss you.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.220
But a year

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.900
has 365 days.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.860
How about the remaining 65 days?

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.940
In the remaining 65 days...

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.300
None of your business.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.460

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.020
I won't marry anyone else.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.140
♪...to pass the time.♪

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.460
♪Can I still have drinks♪

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.300

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.100
(Art of War)

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.700
Judging from the days,

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.860
they must have arrived at Xuanhu City.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.380
Your Highness,

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.540
will Chen Qianqian borrow
troops from Xuanhu City

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.300
and make a comeback?

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.700
Chen Qianqian is unruly and self-willed.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.340
She dared to make trouble

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.620
because our mother dotes on her.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.860
In Xuanhu City, men are in power.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.940
She couldn't have
a chance to stir up trouble.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.660
(Xuanhu City)

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.580
The one who's leading the horse
is our young master?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.820
He's leading the horse for Ms. Chen?

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.700
Is it really okay?

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.620
You and I are a couple.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.940
Let's act here the same way

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.660
as we do in Huayuan.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.140
Young Master, welcome back!

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.300
Young Master, His Majesty
and Her Majesty asked you...

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.060
...and accompanying persons
to enter the city as soon as possible.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.740
They've been waiting for a long time.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.580
I'll take you to the City Owner's Mansion

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.220
to meet my father and mother.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.620
People here are so hospitable to us.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.220
They're not welcoming us.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.900
I used to suffer heart disease.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.100
Such a thing has never happened.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:21.820
Of course,

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.940
it won't happen again.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.100
Do you know where Han Shuo is?

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.620
Our young master needs to pay respects
to His Majesty and Her Majesty.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.220
Miss, please wait for him in the back garden

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:35.940
with other ladies.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.940
You called her Miss? How dare you?

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.340
She's the Third Princess of Huayuan City

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.100
and the respected Crown Princess.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.700
She was.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:43.780
Repeat it if you dare.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.740
Forget about it. When in Rome,
do as the Romans do.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.780
Sir, please stay here.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.660
Males and females are treated
differently in Xuanhu City.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.980
The back garden is a place for
female members of noble families

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.420
to gather together.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.620
As an irrelevant man, you can't go inside

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.300
unless you're castrated.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.980
It's okay. I'll go there alone.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.300
Wait for me here.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.180
Xiaoqian, why are you nervous?

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.580
You felt just like a fish in water
when in Huayuan City.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.580
Why are you like a fish
out of water in Xuanhu?

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.220
Life is like a drama. It all depends
on your acting skills.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.180
You can do it.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.940
Her Majesty arrives.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.860
Lin Qi.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.580
Lin Qi.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.460
In Xuanhu City, men have the final say.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.980
So, women here

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.900
are quiet and restrained.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:44.780
It makes sense.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.900
Sit down.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.580
The feast starts now.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.020
Your Majesty,

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.580
she's the girl brought back
by Young Master Han

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.700
from Huayuan City.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.900
She's Chen Qianqian.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:11.900
Nice to meet you, Your Majesty.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.700
I'm Han Shuo's wife.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.340
Are you Qianqian?

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.540
Yes.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.020
Enjoy your meal first.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.060
In Xuanhu City,

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.100
a married woman needs
to look after parents-in-law.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.380
When Her Majesty is having a meal,

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.060
you need to distribute the foods for her.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.500
Filial piety is the
foundation of all virtues.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.660
I should do that.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.620
Young Master Han won't leave
now that he's back, right?

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.420
I heard that his heart disease
has been cured.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.860
He doesn't need to marry
into Huayuan City, right?

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.380
That was a lie in the first place.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.020
As a man, how can he marry
into another family?

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.260
I heard women had
the final say in Huayuan City.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.580
That's unacceptable.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.380
I heard

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.180
Chen Qianqian claimed to be
a princess of the first rank.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.660
It seems

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.940
she has a bad reputation.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.700
She's unreasonable and ridiculous.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.300
She's even illiterate.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.300
Rumors are fiercer than tigers.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.860
What to do

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.260
if Han Shuo's mother misunderstands me too?

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.500
Your Majesty.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.620
You're clever.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.860
I'm expert at food.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.300
Good.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.900
Tell me what else you like
to do at ordinary times.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.020
Nothing special.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.980
I've been learning poetry
at clan school since childhood.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.660
I help my mother deal with
public affairs when I'm available.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.300
Sometimes,

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.020
I discuss poetry and prose with my sisters.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.900
On the spur of the moment,

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.940
I'll go hunting in the mountains.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.300
I'll play the game of go
with my teacher when I'm tired.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.260
When I'm in the streets,
I'll help those in need.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.300
Once the common people are in trouble,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.660
I'll lead troops to clean up
bandits in the mountains.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.180
I want to try my best

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.300
to be a qualified Crown Princess.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.340
Do you have a sense of shame or not?

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.300
That's right.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.580
The Third Princess is deeply respected

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.300
by the common people in Huayuan.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.740
Lack of talent in a woman is a virtue.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.540
In Xuanhu City,

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.340
what a woman should avoid most
is to be seen in public.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.140
You call that "to be seen in public"?

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.260
Is there anything even worse?

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.100
She used to go to the Music
and Dance Academy eight times a day.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.580
It's...

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.220
Um. It's not like what you thought.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.700
The Music and Dance Academy
is run by my family.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.060
It's conservative.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.540
Can you keep silent?

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.820
Shuo, you must have had a rough time.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.540
Has your heart disease been cured?

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:01.900
Father,

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.620
it has.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.380
That's great.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.820
Besides having your heart disease cured,

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.580
what else have you done?

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.220
To get rid of Huayuan's
Crown Princess, Chen Qianqian,

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.220
assassinate Huayuan's City Owner

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.220
and exploit the situation to conquer Huayuan

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.180
and occupy the black stone mine?

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.260
You had planned to do
all those things before you left,

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.900
but you ended up doing none of them.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.660
I don't want to make things
difficult for you.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.700
You didn't kill Chen Qianqian,

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.740
Huayuan's City Owner

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.340
or any of the common people there.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.820
I understand why you made
the decision and I agree to it.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.900
I just want to ask you

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.340
why you didn't get the mine.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.380
Oh my god. What are you doing?

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.380
I'm going back to Huayuan.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.820
We can't.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.900
The Second Princess wants to kill you.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.140
I know.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.380
I made this decision
after careful consideration.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.620
Now that conditions are tough at both places,

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.340
why don't I choose the one

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.580
where I'm happier?

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.380
Am I right?

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.100
You still want to be comfortable and happy?

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.020
You're so careless.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.420
You want to die?

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.740
Do you think I can survive if I stay here?

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.540
If you want to go back to your hometown,

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.300
you need to copy "Female Virtues" 100 times

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.140
and be familiar with the rules.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.660
It's so hard for me!

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.060
What's up?

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.940
Don't you know that?

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.780
People in Xuanhu

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.580
give Crown Princess their attitude.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.580
She also needs to follow "Three Obedience",
"Four Virtues" and "Seven Grounds for Divorce".

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.940
If she violates any of them,

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.180
you'll divorce her.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.500
She is even requested to copy it 100 times.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.340
How could it be like that?

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.340
It's always been the case in our city.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.500
Why can't Young Master's wife obey them?

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.420
See?

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.140
I'll do it.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.940
You'll get a divorce in the following cases:
you're not obedient to the in-laws;

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.900
you fail to have a female heir...

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.780
Oh, no.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.540
You fail to have a male heir,
now that we're in Xuanhu.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.620
You can leave.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.780
I'll be here.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.100
Madam, please serve our young master.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.260
What are you doing?

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:28.900
In Xuanhu City,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.620
men are superior.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.260
It's against rules.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:32.820
Yeah.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.940
But in my mind,

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.220
you're always superior.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.540
How do you like it? Is the water hot?

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.340
Enough.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.740
They've left. Stop it.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.660
Sorry for letting you suffer wrong.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.620
Are you unhappy?

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.660
You're so nice.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.660
Do you still want to go back?

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.380
No.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.420
I don't want to leave you alone.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.660
You were supposed to do
lots of things in Huayuan,

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.220
but you didn't do any of them

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.300
and even came back with a burden like me.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.060
Did your father make
things difficult for you?

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.500
It's just Xuanhu City.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.020
It's just a big tiger.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.660
No big deal. I have thorns.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.820
Right.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.100
You're the most powerful.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.260
Your Majesties.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.060
How is it going with Han Shuo?

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.340
Young Master...

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.180
He's...

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.540
Go ahead!

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.620
He's washing the feet of
the woman from Huayuan City.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.500
Ridiculous.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.860
As a man,

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.900
how can he humiliate himself?

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.500
He's even washing her feet.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.300
Is it hot?

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.700
No.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:57.980
It's not.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.300
Your Highness.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.460
Your Highness, please go back.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.140
Her Majesty is having a rest.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.980
Please come here tomorrow.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.660
My mother is not very well in health.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.300
It's justified that she
has to have more rest.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.820
In the coming days,

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.300
I'll come and see her every day.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.380
I hope she'll get better as soon as possible.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.300
You're a dutiful daughter.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.100
Let's go to the campsite.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.540
Your Highness,

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.780
Mr. Pei has taken office
as Minister of Defense.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:53.820
We...

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.580
I'd like to see how he's doing there.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.380
Mr. Pei, what should we do

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.580
with prisoners of war from Xuanhu City?

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.700
Kill them.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.340
Your Highness.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.540
Your Highness,

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.540
you don't hold any official post in the army.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.020
Now that you came here without permission,

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.620
you deserve to be punished
according to the military law.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.260
I'm afraid you're lack of experience,

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.220
so I'm here to give you some advice.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.140
People of Xuanhu are sinister and insidious.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.740
They've been coveting

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.420
our black stone mine and black water mine.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.540
As for them,

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.460
we should wipe them
off the face of the earth.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.780
Your Highness,

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.180
who do you think deserve to be killed,

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.380
those who act in bad faith

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.780
or those who're faithful and true?

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.580
What do you mean?

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.700
We fought Xuanhu City Guards

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.460
because we serve different masters.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.340
They were just under orders to attack us.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.740
I don't think they deserve to die.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.500
I'll let them do physical work in the mines.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.180
You made such a big mistake,

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.140
but the City Owner forgave you

00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.620
and gave you a chance to correct it.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:00.700
Why can't you

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.300
give them a chance to survive?

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:02.980
You're a man.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.420
You know nothing about war.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.180
It's a life-or-death struggle

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.780
between Xuanhu and Huayuan.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.620
To be merciful to your enemies

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.500
is to be cruel to yourself.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.980
If you let them survive,

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.820
you're laying by trouble for the future.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.580
Sooner or later,

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.460
you'll be killed by them.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.300
I'm Minister of Defense.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.100
As for how to deal with prisoners of war,

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.100
it's up to me.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.860
I hope

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.620
you can convince your subordinates.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.500
The late Minister Pei

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.340
once said,

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.420
as for war, pugnacity was the only virtue

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.180
and pacifism was the only vice.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.420
Did you hear that?

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.940
That's what Minister of Defense
should be like.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.180
She also said

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.620
only those who were really brave

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.300
could stay rational and end hostilities.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.900
To stop use of weapons
and avoid war is truly military.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.700
Mr. Pei is of a kindly disposition.
He's brave and persistent.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.780
He's quite like his mother as for demeanor.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.620
Mr. Pei, we're willing to follow you.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.020
Books!

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.180
Newly published books.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.940
"The Rumored Third Princess".

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:15.740
The Third Princess...

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.500
Sir,

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.060
is there any book about
the Third Princess and Minister Pei?

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.660
Yes. Sure.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.740
There is also some inside information

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.460
about the Third Princess
and the Second Princess falling out.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.540
It's wonderful.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.700
Pitifully, the Second Princess
won in the end.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.660
I like the Third Princess better.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:29.900
Me too.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.500
Having affection and faith,

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.780
the Third Princess is an excellent woman.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.660
I'm wondering

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.220
why you're here.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.420
Can you tell us

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.980
how you tamed your man?

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.180
It's spread everywhere
Young Master washed your feet.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.380
As women, we were told to follow
Three Obedience and Four Virtues,

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.860
but actually, we hope

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.300
men can listen to us.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.300
In my opinion,

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.140
you're living a happy life.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.220
Young Master obeys you in every way.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.380
I'm so envious.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.700
I hope you can give me some good advice.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.300
If I find a good husband in the future,

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.940
I'm sure to pay you back.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.820
Please forgive me for being gossipy.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.420
What does it mean to tame your man?

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.220
Let him obey you in every way
and do everything as you like?

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:36.820
No.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.620
That's not real equality.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.460
Actually, to learn how to tame your man,

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.780
you should learn to manage yourself first.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.620
Manage myself?

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.660
As women,

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.740
we need to learn how
to stay true to ourselves,

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.620
how to add value to ourselves

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.180
and how to increase our husbands' value.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.260
Then they'll cherish and respect you.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.020
If you love a man,

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.580
it doesn't mean

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.340
you need to rely on him and serve him

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.580
to get what you want from him.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.180
In a relationship,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.180
you need to

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.260
learn to manage yourself

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.420
so that he understands

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.140
the importance of

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.620
your existence.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.140
In this case, he can't do without you.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.140
It makes sense.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.180
Unbelievable.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.820
I've become a relationship expert.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.900
If I told that actor surnamed Han about it,

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.500
he'd never believe it.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.700
I see.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.020
To put it simply,
we need to play hard-to-get.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.820
We need to learn to lose temper.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.820
We need to claim credit when necessary.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.580
Playing the woman,
shedding tears or making a scene.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.820
They all work.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.860
Make sure he's afraid of you.

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.340
Right.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.620
No. You're wrong.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.220
What are you talking about? Wrong.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.420
It's not like that.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.660
Rewrite it.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.940
Tear your notes.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.820
Let's get started.

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:47.700
I don't know

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.180
what's happened to my wife.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.540
She often gave me her attitude recently.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.060
She found fault with everything.

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.180
Someone might have seduced her

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.300
into getting a job.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.700
She's driving everyone crazy.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.060
Same here.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.060
My wife said she needed to
go back to her parental home.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.940
She wants to learn from women of Huayuan

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.180
and wouldn't come back
if I don't wash her feet.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.540
Come on. Shuo.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.540
The two of us

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.300
haven't drunk together for a long time.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.420
Let's drink till we drop today.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.620
Here you are.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:33.700
Qianqian,

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.700
Shuo told me

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.100
you often participated
in political affairs in Huayuan

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.820
and made lots of achievements.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.500
What do you think

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.300
those guys should do

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.980
with their wives' problems?

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.700
I'd like to ask you

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.980
who manages household affairs in your family.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.940
My wife.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.260
Who brings up children?

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.620
My wife.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.060
Who takes care of your parents?

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.860
My wife.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.460
Have you ever thought about that?

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.340
Your wife is like

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.140
a servant that has to

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.620
take care of you,

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.500
your children and your parents.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.700
It seems she stays at home
and doesn't need to work,

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.780
but actually,

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.100
she holds three posts simultaneously.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.740
Everyone,

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.380
have you ever said to your wife,

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.980
"Thank you for what you've done.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.340
What should I do without you?"

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:32.940
We've never said

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.220
those words

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.740
to our stewards, cooks or servants.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.980
Do you mean

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.820
you just consider your wife

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.980
as your steward and servant?

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.340
Ridiculous. This is sophistry.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.180
Young Master even washed her feet.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.100
When all goes to all,

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.820
women can only do those things.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.740
What else could they do?

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.700
No.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.300
Women can do housework at home

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.300
and also handle political affairs

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.340
in court.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.060
You're arrogant.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.140
Let me test you.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.940
According to census data
gathered by Ministry of Statistics,

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.140
the birth rate has been decreasing.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:10.860
To figure out why...

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.380
It's because something has
changed about marriage, right?

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.460
Women began to divorce and remarry

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.100
and some even chose to always stay single,

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.620
which caused declining birth rates

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.060
and less young men.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.420
Do you know why it happened?

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.940
Men in Xuanhu City consider
themselves always right

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.420
and make decisions

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:37.860
without asking their partners' opinions.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.580
Bluntly, it's male chauvinism.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.980
They want you to do everything as they say.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.260
Nobody will love a man like that.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.540
In my opinion,

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.260
it's you women that are making trouble.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.820
Men of Xuanhu are handsome
and highly esteemed.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:51.900
Nobody won't like us.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.980
In the future, anyone aged 16 or above

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.260
will get a fine if they're single.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.260
A fine?

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.740
Getting taxed for being single?

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.900
The problem is still unsolved in this case.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.060
If it doesn't work,

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.900
then just imprison them.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.020
Absurd.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.100
Is the current situation caused

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.220
by women?

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.020
Obviously, it's caused by men.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:10.740
Instead of thinking about

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.340
how to change men,

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.540
you blame everything on women.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:15.860
Interesting.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.900
In your opinion,

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.340
what to do?

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.780
Forget about it if you can't figure it out,

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.820
lest you waste our time.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.220
Allow people of Xuanhu
to marry people of Huayuan.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.780
Women are superior to men in Huayuan

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.460
and it's the opposite in Xuanhu.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.180
The two cities have been irreconcilable
since ancient times.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.540
How could such marriages be possible?

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.380
Now that Xuanhu and Huayuan
have been in a stalemate,

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.740
people in both cities have been influenced.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.260
In the final analysis,
it's about cultural difference.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.300
Take "tiger" as an example.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.780
In Xuanhu City, it means
"mighty and powerful".

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.140
But in Huayuan City,

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.740
it means "silly, rash and mindless".

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.540
What did you say?

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.700
It began to mean "cute" in these years.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.660
Internally, we can

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.260
ease the decline in births.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.780
Externally, we can

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.220
resolve misunderstandings
between the two cities

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.900
caused by cultural difference

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.220
and also exchange resources.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.980
Then, the common people
can live and work in peace.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.020
They'll enjoy a good and prosperous life.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:20.740
What do you think?

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.700
No man dares to marry a woman from Huayuan.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.580
But your wives, daughters and sisters

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.100
want to marry men of Huayuan.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.500
He's smooth-tongued.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.060
He's strong and brave.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.780
He's gentle and considerate.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.460
He's handsome and stupid.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.700
There are different kinds of men.
You name it.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.540
Girls, do you want to marry them?

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.340
As the saying goes, a woman usurping
a man's power will destroy a family.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.940
It's better that women
stay at home and don't work.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.780
So much for today.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:30.940
Father,

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.700
I think what Xiaoqian said

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.420
makes sense.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.220
Hold your tongue.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:38.940
I told you to get the mine.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.740
What did you get?

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.100
Is she a mine?

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.540
Can she burn?

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.900
No. I can't.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:59.540
(City Owner's Mansion)

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:00.900
Your Highness.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.860
Please hand over your weapon.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:16.900
These guys

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.460
don't seem to be the previous City Guards.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.820
I heard the City Owner had heightened alert.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.220
She selected generals and soldiers
herself to be guards.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.420
Will she be wary of me all her life?

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.300
Your Highness.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.620
It's not easy for the City Owner
to call you in.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.180
You need to be very cautious

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.820
and persuade her to forgive you.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.660
I know that.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.260
Mother.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.380
Explain it.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.780
Mother, I don't know this guy at all.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.820
He's confessed everything.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.380
What else do you want to say?

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.340
Mother, please forgive
my momentary recklessness.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.100
Momentary recklessness?

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.300
Asshole.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.180
How can you be so ruthless?

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.740
Do you know?

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.620
Qianqian played dead and bid farewell to me

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.140
so that you can take her place.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.940
She did that for me?

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.100
In your mind, she's right
no matter what she does.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.020
She's always loyal and obedient.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.300
Do you think

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.780
I'm that heartless

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.300
and ungrateful?

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.060
Aren't you?

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.660
Mother, you once told me,

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.420
to do something big,

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.220
we couldn't be swayed by emotions.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.060
I just don't want you to
give yourself over to blind emotions.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.180
I didn't want you to kill your family.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.740
Chen Qianqian didn't die.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.740
She's escaped to Xuanhu City.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.540
Do I have to thank you

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.260
for letting her go?

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.060
I really didn't expect it.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.540
I treated you as my biological daughter.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.420
But in the end,

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.860
you want to kill my own daughter.

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.980
Do you mean

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.180
I'm not your daughter?

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.900
I treated the late Minister Pei
like my sister.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.260
After she died at her post that year,

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.580
I took you to my mansion

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.700
considering you were too young
and nobody took care of you.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.500
I ordered everyone to keep it a secret.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.140
Unexpectedly,

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.260
you're so wildly ambitious and dangerous.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.100
You sent guys to kill Qianqian

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.620
because you're afraid

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.980
she may come back to take your place.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.460
But do you know?

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.900
I can issue an order now

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.660
to make you become Crown Princess

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.420
and even the new City Owner.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.700
Then the whole Huayuan City will be yours.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.980
But look at yourself.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.700
Your virtues can't compare
with your position.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.620
The common people in the city

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.180
and City Guards who
followed you over the years

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.580
don't want to listen to you.
