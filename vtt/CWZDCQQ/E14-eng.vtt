=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 14)

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.820
(Yueli Mansion)

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.860
(Defense Map of Huayuan Coty)

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.260
(Defense Map of Huayuan Coty)

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.820
Defense map?

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.580
He came from Pei's Mansion,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.380
which is the former Minister of Defense
Pei Wujiang's private house.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.700
It's not hard for him to get the defense map.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.140
He aims to frame me for
unlawful possession of the defense map?

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.780
Luckily, we've found it out in time,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.780
or he'd have his way.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.100
Put it back.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.940
Without helping him achieve his aim,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.460
I couldn't achieve mine.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.900
I've had enough of

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.100
acting as the Crown Princess.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.660
I hope Yingying can do it well

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.060
this time

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.580
and won't let me down.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.060
Your Highness.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.060
(The Crown Princess illegally possesses
the defense map and tries to rebel.)

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.060
(The evidence can be found in her mansion.)

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.140
Defense map?

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.820
Your Highness, we don't know who reported it.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.100
What if it's false,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.780
just like the spy case last time?

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.300
If it's false, I'll just be scolded at worst.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.340
But if it's true,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.660
Chen Qianqian will have to

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.460
give up her position as the Crown Princess.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.500
Do you mean...

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.060
Concentrate forces.
We'll go to Yueli Mansion.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.900
Got it.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.980
Your Highness,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.100
no relevant evidence has been found.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.660
How could it be possible?

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.540
Is the tip-off false?

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.180
Someone from Yueli Mansion reported that

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.860
the Crown Princess wanted to rebel.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.300
Who's the informant?

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.940
Su Ziying?

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.380
Hasn't Minister Pei asked you

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.140
to be always loyal to the Crown Princess?

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.460
It's true I work for the Crown Princess,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.100
but as one of the citizens of Huayuan City,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.460
I can't do nothing when she refused
to come to her senses.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.900
I saw her hide the defense map

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.740
when I was cleaning up her study.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.300
Your Highness.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.180
Bad news. Our mansion is being searched.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.740
Why are you making a noise?

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.540
It once happened.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.980
Let me know when they're done.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.780
But...

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.060
Your Highness,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.060
you always bring trouble to yourself.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.860
It makes things so difficult for me.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.460
(Aiming high)

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.370
It's not there.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.060
I've told you

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.420
to let me know after they're done.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.700
I haven't done my make-up yet.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.980
Your Highness, the defense map
is hidden here.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.340
Yingying,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.820
you finally did something great.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.700
Ziying, don't you have a guilty conscience?

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.820
How can you do this to the Crown Princess?

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.420
I shouldn't have treated you as my brother.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.580
You're not faithful!

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.340
I know where my loyalty lies.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.020
I'm faithful to our young master

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.180
and the Third Princess,

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.740
but I can't act against my conscience.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.980
That's right.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.340
The map is hidden by me.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.660
He didn't frame me.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.180
Chuchu, investigate it
and find the truth out.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.500
When this case is settled,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.180
let's go back to places where we should go.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.580
Open the box.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.580
Look carefully

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.340
and find out what I've hidden.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.340
Maybe it'll make me lose my reputation,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.060
be considered shameless

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.220
and even have to step down from my position.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.900
(Aiming high)

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.980
Young Master, don't worry.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.580
I've replaced the defense map

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.940
with something else.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.340
As long as I'm here,

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.020
Su Ziying won't have
a chance to hurt Qianqian.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.420
Have you sent someone to notify Pei Heng?

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.100
Yes, I have.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.780
I think he'll be here soon.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.540
I'd like to see

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.900
if Pei Heng dares to see Qianqian again

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.500
as this thing happens.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.020
It'll really make you lose your reputation,

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.260
but you don't have to step
down from your position.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.780
What?

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.180
Impossible.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.020
Go have a look. All of you go have a look.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.260
Well.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.700
It won't incur popular indignation.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.900
It's human nature, after all.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.780
-Human... -Right?

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.260
It's shameful, indeed.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:23.860
Exactly.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.260
But the Crown Princess is
just that type of person.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.900
Definitely.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.780
There is nothing to be surprised at.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.820
Yeah.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.780
It's just a defense map.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.900
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.900
The Crown Princess deserves her reputation.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.300
They're portraits.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.420
I think

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.540
it's Minister Pei.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.020
She hid the portraits of

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.300
Minister Pei in secret.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.540
Shut up.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.660
Don't say another word.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.580
No. Chuchu.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.980
I didn't hide these.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.900
I didn't. Someone wants to frame me.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.380
The two of you worked together

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.100
to make a fool of me.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.980
Your Highness, you got it wrong.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.140
I didn't mean to fool you.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.980
Who did it?

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.300
Your Highness.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.380
Your Highness, Minister Pei is here.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.140
Go ahead.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.340
The Crown Princess is full of cunning tricks.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.980
She must have become aware of something

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.700
so that she's replaced it
to get out of trouble.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.860
I did see her hide the defense map.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.860
Su Ziying,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.660
you reported Qianqian for stealing
Huayuan City's confidential documents?

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.860
Young Master, I saw it with my own eyes.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.620
Where is the map?

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:49.940
It...

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:52.940
Qianqian.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.180
Pei Heng,

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.580
please trust me.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.580
I'm innocent. I...

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.700
Such stuff is found in your study.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.220
Shouldn't you care about Minister Pei?

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.580
Yes, I should.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.260
So, both of us are innocent.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.220
Su Ziying, look at what you've done.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.260
I have no idea.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.980
The Third Princess set me up.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.620
She's scheming.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.220
She showed me the defense map on purpose

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.740
and then replaced it with portraits.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.940
She seduced me into bringing a false charge.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.180
Shut up.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.340
You're the culprit.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.740
Su Ziying must have ganged
up with the Second Princess,

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.100
or she couldn't have known
the Crown Princess hid these portraits.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.460
She's had the whole mansion searched.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.060
What are you talking about?

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.620
I did this alone.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.060
It has nothing to do
with the Second Princess.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.860
Chen Qianqian is so brutal.
She doesn't deserve to be the Crown Princess.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.620
I framed her

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.860
because she bullied me.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.900
It has nothing to do
with the Second Princess.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.420
I bullied you?

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.540
Su Ziying, when did I offend you?

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.460
Su Ziying, stop there!

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.140
How dare you try to be hired as a lieutenant

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.300
by pretending to be a girl?

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.140
I'll beat you to death.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.180
Thousands of people in Huayuan City

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.540
have been bullied and humiliated by you.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.940
How could you remember that?

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.540
Chen Qianqian. It's Chen...

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.740
When can you stop blaming
me for what she did?

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.860
Now that he's confessed,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.940
let me get rid of
this traitor for you, Qianqian.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.860
Guards!

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.740
Su Ziying framed the Crown Princess.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.900
Imprison him at once till a verdict is given.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.180
Got it!

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:31.940
Su...

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.540
He's a traitor.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.140
Chuchu.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.420
Chuchu, listen to me.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.980
I really don't want to be the Crown Princess.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.900
I'll find out another way to get it done.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.980
At the foot of Weimeng Mountain,

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.460
when we played chess,

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.060
you promised

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.780
you'd return two things to me.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.860
As for the position of Crown Princess,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.500
you can take your time.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.300
But as for the other,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.700
Qianqian,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.340
you need to step on it.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.620
I'm sorry, Pei Heng.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.220
Qianqian, stop kicking yourself.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.900
I was so negligent

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.700
that I let such a guy stay around you.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.580
You almost got into big trouble.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.060
I don't care what Su Ziying did to me.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.140
What worries me is that you got involved.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.540
I... I'll figure out a way
to bring fair back to you.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.580
Well. Who on earth did it? I...

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.420
Nobody else.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.660
It's me.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.100
You?

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.460
I've long found Su Ziying wanted to hurt you,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.500
so I asked Bai Ji to keep a watch on him.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.420
Just as expected,

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.420
he tried to frame you for
possession of the defense map,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.820
so I asked Bai Ji to replace
it with something else.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.260
Don't worry.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.060
I'll always protect you.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.180
Pei Heng can't do it,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.540
but I can do.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.700
I'm sure Pei Heng will be ashamed

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.340
to come see you again.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.460
Aren't you ashamed to see me?

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.380
Is this the way you're protecting me?

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.860
I understand you don't like Pei Heng,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.700
but why did you humiliate him and me?

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.620
Why did you do that?

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.700
Qianqian, what are you doing?

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:37.980
Han Shuo,

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.020
are you so eager to be cheated on?

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.020
Wait.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.980
Bai Ji, it...

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.100
Why are they portraits?

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.780
Qianqian, I know nothing about it.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.420
Bai Ji did all...

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.460
You're quick-witted.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.180
You just admitted personally

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.580
that you wanted to embarrass Pei Heng.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.460
You must have ordered someone to draw it.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.060
It...

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:05.740
Han Shuo,

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.500
stop putting Bai Ji in the wrong.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.940
Bai Ji, where did you get it?

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.380
I found it just in the box.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.380
It was all of a sudden.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.740
When I took away the defense map,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.060
I dug out these paintings from the bottom
of the box without extra trouble

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:16.740
and put them on the top.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.860
Without having a look at them,

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.340
I closed the box.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:28.900
I hid them?

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.060
You hid them at the bottom of the box.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.740
Uh... No.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.420
There must be some misunderstanding.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.660
Bai Ji must have got it wrong.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.100
The evidence is irrefutable, Chen Qianqian.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.780
Stop trying to put Bai Ji in the wrong.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.260
You're married to me.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.620
Why do you still keep the portraits of

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.060
Pei Heng?

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.580
You're

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.860
a fickle woman.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.300
If you lived in Xuanhu City,

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.780
you must have long been abandoned.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.420
How about

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.500
you divorce me?

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.940
Now that you care about it so much,

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.220
let's get a divorce.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.460
You want to divorce me for Pei Heng?

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.260
You said you wanted to divorce me.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.780
Yeah. I'm supposed to divorce you,

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.620
but I won't, considering
that it's your first offense,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.620
no,

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.100
considering that you just
did it out of curiosity

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.540
a long time ago

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.300
when you were still young and ignorant.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.060
You've never watched them again

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.660
now that they're put at the bottom of the box

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.660
and you've even forgotten you once did that.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:28.660
Right?

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.140
Yes.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.660
Um. I'll let this issue pass.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.380
I have to thank you
for making an excuse for me.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.660
-You bet! -Even I didn't think of that.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.100
Do you really want me to divorce you?

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.580
In this case,

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.700
I'm broad-minded and generous, right?

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.700
Yes, you are.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.820
But it's not finished.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.220
What will Pei Heng think of me?

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.180
How dare you mention him again?

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.540
Chen Qianqian, I'm warning you.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.740
If you dare to mention
the word "divorce" again,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.580
I...

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.740
Young Master, calm down.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.060
You...

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.420
It's none of my business.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.500
Bai Ji, get out.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.620
I was even reported
because of some paintings.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.540
The portraits are lifelike.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.540
Did you hear it?

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.420
I'm ashamed to say that.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.980
The Crown Princess hides
portraits of Minister Pei.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.940
There is nothing to be surprised at.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.140
She was like that

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.660
before she became the Crown Princess.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.940
Isn't it said the Crown Princess
has returned to the right path?

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.780
An evildoer who reforms herself
is more precious than gold.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.820
Maybe she's gone back to the original path.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.860
Don't you think what you said is weird?

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.260
Alright. Let's go.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.740
We thought Minister Pei
was attracted to the Crown Princess

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.900
and Young Master Han took away his love.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.220
But it turns out the truth is

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.780
the Crown Princess is into Minister Pei

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.060
and she even hides portraits
of him in her mansion

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.780
to overcome lovesickness,

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.100
no, to ease the pain of missing him.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.780
(Pei's Mansion)

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.460
Pei Heng, I'm sorry

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.540
I got you involved.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.860
But trust me.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.740
I've destroyed all those portraits.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.740
Don't say sorry.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.340
I don't blame you.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.060
I even did that to you.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.220
Do you still not blame me?

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.180
I don't mind.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.380
You don't...

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.300
You have to.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.060
You can even lose your temper.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.860
You're into me

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.020
and I'm also into you.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:34.940
There is nothing wrong

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.420
about that.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.140
Wait.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.180
You're into...

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.140
Well. I mean,

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.660
is it because of the
love poem or the portraits?

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.380
I did hide the portraits there,

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.460
but I didn't look at them.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.500
Do you believe me?

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.860
I used to be dull.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.660
We were engaged to each other,

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.580
but I often avoided you.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.700
I didn't know what I want

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.140
until Han Shuo appeared.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:09.860
Qianqian,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.740
I won't let anyone take you away from me.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.540
You don't need to

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.460
look at those portraits in secret.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.380
How could you be into me?

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.620
Qianqian,

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.740
this morning, I told Her Majesty

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.100
I wanted you to divorce Han Shuo

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.300
and remarry me now that we
got engaged when we were kids.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.860
From now on,

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.460
I'll take care of you myself.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.300
Mother!

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.700
Mother,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.020
Pei Heng told you he wanted
me to divorce Han Shuo

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.460
and remarry him?

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.660
That's right.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.300
What did you say?

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.340
I want to ask you a question.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.820
Do you like Pei Heng?

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.580
No. I don't.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.780
You don't?

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.740
Then why are these found in your mansion?

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.740
You need to see through the appearance
to perceive the essence.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.580
Don't be blinded by false impressions.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.100
In my opinion, Han Shuo doesn't like you.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.100
He's a cold fish and stubborn.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.780
He's seduced you into
making mistakes several times.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.140
I don't think he's the right guy for you.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.020
Pei Heng is different.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.700
I see him grow up.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.220
We know his background.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.620
When Chen...

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.780
When I decided to marry Han Shuo,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.140
why didn't you stop me?

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.940
I didn't expect that

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.660
Han Shuo could live that long.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.940
I even need to mediate the conflict
between my husband and my mother.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.900
What are you murmuring?

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.340
Mother, how about like this?

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.580
Let's each take a step back.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.140
I'll divorce Han Shuo

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.660
but I don't marry Pei Heng, okay?

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.140
Look. I can't break Pei Heng's heart

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.500
immediately after I break Han Shuo's, right?

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.820
As the most handsome man in Huayuan City,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.940
Pei Heng belongs to all women.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.380
You know I'm unfaithful in love.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.100
If I'm hard upon him or treat him badly,

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.020
I'll anger the public.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.580
But you've already brought discredit on him.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.740
It's fair and reasonable

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.500
that you marry him.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.540
Mother.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.740
Fine. Forget about it.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.940
I won't push you to marry Pei Heng,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.220
but as for the divorce,

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.540
I'll issue an order at a proper time.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.460
Mother, I think

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.940
it's better for me to discuss it with him

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.100
before you issue an order.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.100
It's just a divorce.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.300
Why bother discussing with him?

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.940
I have to do that.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.740
Han Shuo is short-tempered.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.380
He's liable to fly into a rage.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.060
I need to persuade him.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.260
You don't understand.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.860
The Crown Princess is straightforward.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.300
She's the same as you

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.740
when you were young.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.740
She's changeable.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.500
I don't know if it's the right choice

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.620
to let her be the Crown Princess.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.500
Take the medicine while it's hot.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.740
Speaking of that, I heard

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.900
the Second Princess

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.620
had the Crown Princess's mansion
searched yesterday.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.300
Chuchu searched Qianqian's mansion?

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.660
Have I ignored something

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.100
these days?

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.740
Hurry.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.380
Go to Xingzi Mansion

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.820
and tell the Second Princess

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.060
that I want to see her.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.940
I have something important to say to her.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.700
You even dared to frame the Crown Princess.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.380
You should count yourself lucky
that you're not executed.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.900
You want to see the Second Princess?

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.900
In your dreams!

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.540
I want to see the Second Princess.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.220
Let me see the Second Princess!

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.260
How should I tell Han Shuo I want a divorce

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.540
so that he won't get mad at me?

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.500
Han Shuo,

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.500
let's get a divorce.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.660
I've rekindled feelings with Pei Heng.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.180
Han Shuo,

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.500
my mother wants me to divorce you.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.540
She said if I didn't,

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.260
she wouldn't let me be the Crown Princess.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.780
You know, I'll die

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.700
if I can't be the Crown Princess.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.220
I did it wrong.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.100
Han Shuo, Chuchu and you are a real couple.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.420
I shouldn't have existed here.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.340
What's wrong?

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.060
My legs are weak.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.780
I've said I don't blame you
for those erotic paintings.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.380
Don't mention that word.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.460
It's the cause of all kinds of wickedness.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.940
I'll stay away from pornographic material.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.460
Han Shuo, actually I have
something to say to you.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.620
My mother...

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.340
My mother said we needed to...

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.780
Needed what?

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.860
Needed...

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.660
... needed a peaceful and quiet life.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.300
I haven't got fully prepared.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.220
Your Highness.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.980
Minister Pei has something sent here for you.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.060
What is it?

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.140
He asked me to cook red bean
porridge to dispel dampness.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.260
Red beans are symbols of love.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.020
Our young master sent them to you

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.700
to express his yearning for you,
but not to let you cook porridge.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.540
Great.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.900
Pei Heng is determined
to set himself against me.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.980
Young Master Han, you got it wrong.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.580
The City Owner will issue an order soon

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.620
that you and the Crown Princess
need to get a divorce.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.620
When you married her,

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.660
the flower parade, sacrifice to Heaven
and the wedding ceremony were all cancelled.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.060
Your marriage is not legal.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.860
So, our young master didn't
set himself against you.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:25.980
Besides,

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.980
he got engaged to the Crown Princess
when he was a kid.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.860
They're...

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:30.660
Bai Ji,

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.820
what are you waiting for?

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.780
Throw him out.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.160
As for that box of red beans,

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.060
scatter them at the gate
of the Pei's Mansion.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.440
Red beans.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.620
My red beans.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.820
I need them to cook porridge.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.740
I know why your legs were weak.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.620
Get a divorce?

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.780
I like you.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.620
I can't do without you.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.060
You know that, right?

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.260
Yes.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.580
I'm honest,

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.620
kind and gentle,

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.260
but I'll also lose control of myself

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.860
if I'm cornered.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.980
You know that too, right?

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:34.980
Good girl.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.620
Your Highness,

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.940
what's bothering you?

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.180
I feel that

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.380
Banana is weird.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.420
Why?

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.540
Your Highness,

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.100
a new character showed up?

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.460
It's Peach.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.140
He used to desire for nothing

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.580
and stand aloof from the world.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.620
But one day, he told Orange

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.860
he loved her.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.180
What to do?

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.380
Did Peach dare to compete with Banana?

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.060
Isn't he afraid he'll be killed?

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.260
How about letting Banana kill Peach?

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.340
Then the story will continue

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.740
among the three of them:

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.700
Orange, Banana and Apple.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.660
No way.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.780
Peach is Orange's original aspiration.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.660
What does it mean?

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.700
It means he's her favorite

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.300
in the script.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.300
Then why didn't Orange

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.540
accept Peach?

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.420
In this case, Apple and Banana

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.060
would naturally become a couple.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.220
The four of them would be two couples.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.460
Orange doesn't love Peach

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.380
like a woman loves a man.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.500
Obviously, Orange has fallen
in love with Banana.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.180
Stop talking nonsense. It's impossible.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.180
Impossible.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.220
The fruit circle is messy.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.180
Your Highness,

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.900
with all due respect,

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.900
I'm afraid you don't understand

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.060
those characters' feelings.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.540
So, how could the audience understand?

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.620
I even don't know

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.460
what I'm thinking about,

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.580
let alone those characters.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.860
No wonder I can't write a good love story.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.740
Look at the situation.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.020
It's messy enough.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:41.740
It...

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.060
Such being the case,

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.140
how shall I develop it?

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.300
Your Highness,

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.300
is there any other plot or scene you wrote?

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.020
Maybe I can give you some advice.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:52.380
Good question.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.180
That day,

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.780
the sister of Apple was going to

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.540
throw an embroidered ball
to choose a husband.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.580
-Your Highness. -Here.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.580
Your Highness.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.860
Pass it to me.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.340
The Princess Royal has chosen

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.340
Mr. Su Mu as her husband.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.340
And then?

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.060
But unexpectedly,

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.060
Banana bombed the city.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.380
Protect the Princess Royal.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.340
Mother!

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.060
It's getting close.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.460
The Double Seventh Festival
is around the corner.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.740
Your Highness,

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.500
so many changes have happened

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.980
to the previous part.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.580
Some plots even didn't happen.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.100
Banana couldn't make the same choice.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.140
But

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.500
Banana has been a fierce beast
from the beginning.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.940
He'd been considered
a sick cat for a long time.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.100
I hope he won't demonstrate his power.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.340
Xuanhu City would destroy Huayuan City.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.220
It's not a joke.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.460
(Posthouse)

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.820
Young Master, let me pay my respects to you.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.140
Young Master, we're here

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.780
under the order of your father.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.260
We aim to

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.100
lay explosives in the city in advance.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.300
When the City Owner of Huayuan shows up

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.980
on a festooned vehicle
at the Double Seventh Festival,

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.140
we'll ignite the explosives
to get rid of her.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.540
Huayuan City will be thrown
into turmoil without a leader.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.620
By then, we'll collaborate
with forces from outside

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.100
to conquer Huayuan City at one go.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.860
It's not the right time yet.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.500
I need to think about it.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.380
Your heart disease has been cured.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.860
There is nothing to be afraid of.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.580
Do you want

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.660
to keep pretending

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.100
to be docile and obedient?

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.740
As long as we conquer Huayuan City,

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.700
the black stone mine

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.940
will belong to Xuanhu City.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.340
Do everything as I said.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.620
You know the consequences of acting rashly.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.100
Got it.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:11.780
(Auspiciousness lights up
the virtuous household)

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.020
How many people from
Xuanhu City have arrived?

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:13.860
I heard it was 50.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.460
Only 50? Unbelievable.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.860
There is a limit to the number of visitors.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.700
They couldn't be so obedient.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.860
Why is Han Shuo not here?

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.900
The Second Princess gets drunk

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.180
and stops Han Shuo on his way.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.980
Your Highness, why is Her Majesty not here?

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.300
She's caught an illness,

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.380
so she can't be present.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.380
She asked me

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.700
to take good care of you.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.820
I don't have many rules.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.020
Make yourself at home.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.300
Let's get started.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.780
Zi Zhu.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:31.980
Zi Zhu.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.300
Second Princess,

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.740
let's say goodbye here.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.620
I must go.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.220
Stay.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.260
Han Shuo,

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.100
since the day you saved me

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.060
when I was caught in a trap,

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.300
I...

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.280
I couldn't help thinking of you.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:02.820
You're drunk.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.060
I know

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.740
I shouldn't say these words to you,

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.520
but I just can't control myself.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.120
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.880
I just want you to know

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.960
how I feel about you.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.280
Are you sober?

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.820
Now that you don't want
to cause me any trouble,

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.410
don't say those words

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:37.780
you don't think you should say.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.440
No matter how you feel about me,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.470
just keep it to yourself till you die,

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.900
because I don't want to know

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.650
and I don't want Qianqian to know about it.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.260
But Qianqian doesn't like you at all.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.280
If she likes you,

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.580
she should have broken off

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.850
her engagement to Pei Heng.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.840
I'll make it invalid.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:06.990
Why?

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.160
Why does Chen Qianqian have everything?

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:18.820
Your Highness,

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.530
now that you're our young master's wife,

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.100
you and I

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.840
are actually family.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.720
Family?

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.050
Mrs. Han,

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.160
according to seniority in the clan,

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.520
you should call him uncle.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:37.700
Now that it's the first time
you've met each other,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.470
you should pour him a cup of wine.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.780
How dare you?

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.080
As the Crown Princess,

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.020
how could she pour wine for
an inferior officer from Xuanhu City?

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.340
Minister Liu, you're wrong.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.180
No matter what a high status she enjoys,

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.620
she should also respect her elders.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.500
Do people in Huayuan City

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.300
just have no regard for superiors and elders?

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.900
Fine. It's okay if you don't
want to pour wine.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.540
How about performing a dance?

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.660
All of us

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:07.740
want to see

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.300
how women of Huayuan City dance.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.380
Mr. Han,

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.900
speaking of seniors and elders,

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.500
please remember seniors come before elders.

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.700
As Xuanhu City's envoys,

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.980
you're here to pay a formal visit
to the City Owner of Huayuan,

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.100
so the Crown Princess is superior to you.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.100
Besides, in Huayuan City,

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.780
women are superior to men.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.220
Young Master Han

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.660
is the Crown Princess's husband
for the time being,

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.860
but he may get a divorce anytime.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.460
Could it be that

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.740
you just aim to

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.580
take Young Master Han back to Xuanhu City?

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.060
Who are you?

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.140
Now that women are superior in Huayuan City,

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.380
how can you speak here?

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.540
I'm Pei Heng.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.540
The former Minister of Defense
is my late father.

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.180
I'm the Crown Princess's fiancé.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.900
The banquet just started.

00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.900
Don't lose your temper.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.180
Calm down.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.660
They have a long journey

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:02.820
from Xuanhu City to Huayuan City.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.620
They just want us to pour wine
and perform a dance.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.940
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.620
Zi Rui, go.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.500
Ask Han Shuo to come here

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.140
and perform a dance for them.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.700
You've never had a chance

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.980
to see him dance, right?

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.460
It's impossible to do that in Xuanhu City,

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.980
but you can do that in Huayuan City.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.180
I remember

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.420
it's in the Music and Dance Academy

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.260
that I saw him dance for the first time.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.380
The Music and Dance Academy?

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.460
It's really special.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:29.860
Hurry.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.260
Forget about it.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.980
I suddenly lost interest in it.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.820
I don't want to watch.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.740
Not interested?

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.060
What a pity.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.140
Come back.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.100
Drink wine.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.620
I knew you didn't dare
to let him suffer wrong.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:46.940
Neither do I.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.300
The medicine is getting bitter.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.860
It seems running wild works sometimes.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.540
You don't know how embarrassed

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.300
those envoys are.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.180
Those guys from Xuanhu City
have gone too far.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.820
They came here half a month ahead of time.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.380
They must have ulterior motives.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.740
Ask Chuchu

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.460
to investigate it in secret

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.620
in the name of improving public safety.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.060
Got it.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.100
As for Han Shuo,

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.780
his issue has something
to do with the two cities.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.820
I can't let him keep
staying by Qianqian's side.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.220
He's a hidden trouble anyway.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.540
How about letting them divorce?

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.220
I'd like to see

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.820
what Han Shuo will do.

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.780
Your Majesty, do you mean

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.340
you want to test Han Shuo

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.580
on how serious he is
about the Crown Princess.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.020
I hope he won't let me down.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.340
Why did you

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.300
make things difficult
for Qianqian on the banquet?

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.180
We just wanted to

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.900
deal her a head-on blow
at the first encounter.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.060
We didn't aim to watch her dance.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.980
If I say I want to kill you,

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.300
guess

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.900
if I'm serious or just joking.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.740
Young Master, don't be angry.
I know I did it wrong.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.860
Since I came to Huayuan City,

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.980
I've been having a rough time to succeed.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.980
You almost made me fail
on the eve of complete success.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.980
Young Master, under the circumstances,

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.700
don't you think it's you
that almost made yourself fail?

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.220
For a woman,

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.580
you let down so many people of Xuanhu City.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.420
How dare you?

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.340
We're here to support you,

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.260
but you're hesitant.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.940
We had planned

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.340
to get rid of their City Owner
at the Double Seventh Festival

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.100
and then conquer Huayuan City

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.820
by collaborating with forces from outside,

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:53.660
but you hesitated because of a woman.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.340
Young Master,

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.700
we know you're in love with Chen Qianqian.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.220
Your father has agreed

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.060
that she can stay by your side

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.420
as your maidservant

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.100
after we conquer Huayuan City.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.340
I've told you it's not the right time yet.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.100
Young Master.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.180
Young Master, the City Owner
has issued an order that

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.740
you and the Crown Princess
need to get a divorce

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.300
so that she can marry Minister Pei.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:27.340
Here we are.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.860
Go in.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.340
Hold on.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.140
The Crown Princess and Minister Pei...

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.220
Look.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.860
Young Master, the City Owner
just issued an order

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.340
and they already began to date.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.740
I heard they were playmates in childhood.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.660
They must have had an affair.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.060
That's right, Young Master.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.500
If we don't take actions
and conquer Huayuan City,

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.260
I'm afraid the letter announcing divorce

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.460
will be sent to Xuanhu City directly.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.220
If our troops come southward

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.540
and conquer Huayuan City,

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.380
then Chen Qianqian

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.180
will absolutely belong to you.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.380
Exactly.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.460
If you do that,

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.100
I'm sure you can get Chen Qianqian.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.020
That's right, Young Master.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:07.900
Pei Heng,

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.260
thank you for everything you did for me.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.740
I like you.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.740
Of course I want the best for you.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.820
I'm married.

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.140
But your marriage

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.860
is mingled with Huayuan
and Xuanhu's disputes and interests.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.540
He's not serious about you.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:28.860
I know

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.060
you're bewitched by him for the time being,

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:33.620
but I can wait.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.620
Pei Heng,

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.140
I like you as a friend,

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.620
not as a lover.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.020
Can you tell my mother

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.300
you don't like me

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.820
and ask her to take back her words?

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.900
(Risheng Mansion)

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.900
Your Highness.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.420
Yuanyuan is asleep?

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:03.940
Yes.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.380
She spent two more hours on rehabilitation.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.420
She's tired

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.820
and wants to have a rest.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.580
She asked me to have a chat with you.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.540
It's okay.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.340
It happens I need to stay alone.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.900
In the whole Huayuan City,

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.580
I have nowhere to go

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.420
except Yuanyuan's mansion.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.860
Oh. Su Mu,

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.540
please take care of Pei Heng.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.380
I said something hurtful to him.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.310
Your Highness, don't worry.

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.090
Minister Pei

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.440
looks vulnerable,

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.840
but actually, he's strong.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.880
He won't take things to heart.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.460
You're lucky in love.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.180
Of course you have no idea about that.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.160
Me? Lucky in love?

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:49.460
Right.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.420
You and Yuanyuan

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.250
care about each other
and always stay by each other's side.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:54.420
You're...

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.750
Qianqian, what are you talking about?

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.380
Come on.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.970
You're going to throw an embroidered ball

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.940
to choose a husband
at the Double Seventh Festival.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.100
Could it be that the two of you haven't...

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.060
Did I just reveal elements of the plot?

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.380
Yuanyuan, I remember

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.460
I have something else to do.

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.300
I'm leaving.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.580
I'll come here for you later.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.740
Your Highness, take care.
