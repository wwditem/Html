=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 24)

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.060
Have you lost your mind?

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.580
I'm a descendant of the Pei family!
My last name is Pei!

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.660
But what you are doing

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.780
is against Her Majesty's decree

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.700
and disturbing the livelihood of our people,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.900
as well as in defiance
of late Minister Pei's will!

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.020
I treated you whole-heartedly,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.140
yet you switched sides right in front of me!

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.260
Which side are you on exactly?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.660
Surround this place!

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.620
The City Guards are certainly
on the side of the Pei family!

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.020
Mr. Pei.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.740
You are also a descendant of the Pei family,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.340
and you are just as upright

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.100
and talented as late Minister Pei!

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.860
Though you are a man, so what?

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.740
Your Highness.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.860
That day, you personally
smashed the flower token

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.140
and asked us

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.460
to follow the person instead of the token.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.580
And now,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.260
we'll just follow another person.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.460
Fellow brothers and sisters,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.340
bring out the guts of our City Guards!

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.460
I'm willing to follow Mr. Pei!

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.140
Han Shuo!

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.500
Qianqian, watch out!

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.140
Xiaoqian!

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.940
Go get the doctor!

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.620
No! Go get the Princess Royal!

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.220
Yes!

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.540
Han Shuo!

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.140
Han Shuo!

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.580
Han Shuo!

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.300
Han Shuo!

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.380
Han Shuo! Wake up!

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.140
Han Shuo!

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.140
Han Shuo!

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.540
Three out of five.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.300
You've tossed eight times!

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.980
Is the fight over?

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.420
Something happened to Han Shuo!

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.100
(Risheng Mansion)

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.180
I've dressed the wound.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.220
The sword didn't

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.900
stab right to the heart.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.340
That's good!

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.260
I knew

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.020
that after so many things happened,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.420
the story wouldn't develop
as it was written before.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.940
Right?

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.180
What's wrong?

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.020
But his lungs are badly injured.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.820
He doesn't have much time left.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.220
No! No way!

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.980
Yuanyuan, please check again!

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.220
Please! Please check again!

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.900
Xiaoqian.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.700
Let's leave, darling.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.260
I shouldn't have made you die in the story.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.220
It's my fault!

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.460
It's different, Xiaoqian.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.940
I originally

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.180
died for someone

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.260
I didn't love at all.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.340
It wasn't a worthy death.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.860
But now,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.300
I'll die for you,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.020
for Huayuan and Xuanhu.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.940
It'll be a worthy sacrifice.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.900
You didn't make the story end this way.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.780
It's my own

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.580
decision.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.220
You told me

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.100
that people in your world

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.540
didn't understand why you wrote this story,

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.220
why the hero would fall in love
with the heroine.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.100
I have an answer now.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.860
Because you are kind,

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.220
optimistic,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.180
and strong.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.260
You bravely overcame

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.420
the setbacks over and over again.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.180
Being so bright and full of life,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.380
you will be fine

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.380
even without me, right?

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.260
Hope I'm the love of your life.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.220
And hope you won't regret meeting me.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.780
I don't!

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.100
I will never regret it in my life!

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.380
Although

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.100
I once hated you,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.460
rejected you,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.820
feared you,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.100
I felt so lucky

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.100
that when I fell in love with you,

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.900
you were there!

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.460
You were always there!

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.500
This is the best ending.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.740
Just end the story.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.180
Let me see you become the City Owner.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.140
I don't want you to go!

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.940
I don't!

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.700
I won't.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.940
Just pretend that you had a dream.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.580
When you wake up,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.660
just go over the script,

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.740
and you'll see

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.220
I've never left.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.220
Sorry.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.260
I know it's my fault!

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.620
Shuo was right.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.860
As a man, he fulfilled his responsibility.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.740
It was his own choice.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.060
Darling,

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:16.980
let's go inside.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.860
Nothing lasts forever.
Live every moment to the fullest.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.180
Cherish the time

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.060
when Young Master Han is still with you.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.180
This is something from before.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.740
You can

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.380
keep it well.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.900
I've been reappointed
as the Minister of Education.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.820
As you asked,

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.420
I opened a school.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.460
From now on,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.900
boys in Huayuan will have the equal chance

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.100
to go to school as girls do.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.860
People are all

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.820
thankful for your benevolence.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.860
I didn't do it alone.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.940
It's because people are willing to do it

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.180
and accept a better

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.420
life style.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.780
So,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.820
how are you going to punish Chuchu?

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.820
How is he doing?

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.460
He's resting.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.620
When I stabbed you,

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.100
I aimed for a spot that was

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.060
three inches away from your heart.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.900
But I didn't expect

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.180
that Han Shuo would use his body
as a shield to protect you.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.620
You should be very happy now.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.780
Mother favors you,

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.220
sisters are close to you,

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.540
Han Shuo loves you,

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.660
and the citizens adore you.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.300
Everything is yours.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.140
And I

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.700
have become the butt of a joke.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.420
Chuchu,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.580
I'm partially responsible

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.500
for what you've become.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.180
If I died from the very beginning,

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.980
Han Shuo would marry you,

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.900
and you'd be happy together.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.060
You'd be mom's only loving daughter

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.860
and get all her attention.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.820
Su Ziying and Meng Guo
would be enlisted by you.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.500
The citizens of entire Huayuan

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.900
would support you to be the Crown Princess.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.220
Everything would be yours.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.020
But I didn't die.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.780
I survived.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.460
It's also not my fault.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.140
Since I survived,

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.700
I became your rival.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.780
You thought the things you didn't get

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.100
should have belonged to you,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.500
but they were all taken away by me.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.900
But have you ever thought about

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.780
why Han Shuo fell in love
with someone else but you,

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.780
why Su Ziying switched his sides
at the last minute,

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.100
why the citizens of Huayuan ended up

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.300
supporting a nobody like me?

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.020
I don't know how to argue with you.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.980
When a storyteller writes a story,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.340
he usually arranges all kinds

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.860
of coincidences for the roles.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.100
The hero is destined
to fall in love with the heroine.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.500
Supporting roles are meant to be
the stepping stone for the main characters,

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.900
as well as the focus of people's attention.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.620
You were

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.580
supposed to be a heroine.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.580
You could have had a promising life.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.500
But when you came across
a stumbling block like me,

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.900
you didn't know how to deal with it.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.540
So frankly speaking,

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.100
you don't possess the qualities
of a City Owner.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.740
It's the so called "The winner takes it all.
The loser has to fall."

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.020
If you don't trust me,

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.060
I'll prove it to you!

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.740
Do you remember the tale

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.980
we heard when we were little?

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.540
At the Founding Ceremony

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.220
of Huayuan City,

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.540
when the first City Owner

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.660
walked onto the flower path,

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.580
a vision appeared showing the sun and the moon
shining together in the sky

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.220
and the door of heaven opening.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.260
The citizens instantly supported her,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.820
thinking that she'd be a wise ruler.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.580
After that,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.740
people began to believe

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.020
that the vision would appear
if a wise and benevolent person

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.620
were to succeed to the throne.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.380
It's also your wish, right?

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.140
You also wanna see

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.940
if you can make

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.220
that vision appear.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.500
-I don't!
-You do!

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.060
You worked hard every day

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.380
studying literature and practicing Kung Fu.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.980
You were so sure
that you would be the chosen one

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.300
who can usher in that auspicious vision.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.180
I'll give you a chance.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.500
I'll go talk to Mother

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.540
and ask her to hold a succession ceremony.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.900
You can also walk

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.300
onto the flower path

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.100
and see if the same vision

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.420
will appear.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.140
I don't think so.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.540
Then what if it does appear?

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.100
Would Mother

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.700
allow me to walk through the path?

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.700
You,

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.820
Yuanyuan and Qianqian.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.460
The three of you

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.740
can all give it a try.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.980
Whoever can make that vision appear

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.020
while walking down the path,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.300
I will pass my throne to her.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.580
It's fair, isn't it?

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.580
Young Master, you are too weak to get up!

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.620
What are you doing?

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.860
You'll go to the succession ceremony.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.140
It's only a setup for Chuchu,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.660
so that she can realize
that she made a mistake.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.500
I'll just stay aside and watch.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.020
But there's an access to your world
at the succession ceremony.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.460
I made it up!

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.140
The vision is not something
that can appear easily.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.460
That's special effect,
which costs a lot of money.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:38.620
Listen to me.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.300
No matter who walks onto the path,
it'll be the same.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.020
There won't be colorful clouds

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.140
or door of heaven.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.620
How did you know?

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.780
It won't appear

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.820
even if you walks on it?

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.820
Do you want

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.140
my dream to be over?

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.780
I have told you

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.780
that I wouldn't go anywhere.
I'll be here with you!

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.380
I just want to see you at the ceremony

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.740
and remember the way you look

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.580
in your ceremonial costume.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.260
I fear that...

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.100
Okay, I'll wear the costume.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.780
I'll wear it for you.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.180
But I won't

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.100
walk the flower path.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.100
I'll wait for you.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.020
Go ahead.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.180
Easy.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.630
Bai Ji, take good care of him.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:17.920
Yes.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.780
Wait for me.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.940
(City Owner's Mansion)

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.100
(Auspiciousness lights up
the virtuous household)

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.020
(Auspiciousness lights up
the virtuous household)

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.300
The succession ceremony begins now!

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.420
Kneel!

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.260
Wish Huayuan City

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.780
a prosperous and peaceful future!

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.500
Offer incense to heaven!

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.580
Watch out!

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.140
How did this happen?

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.420
I don't believe it!

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.180
It's only a tale!

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.940
It's not true!

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.220
It'll be the same

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.700
no matter who does it!

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.660
Your Highness, be careful!

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:21.980
I'll try.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.900
Let me accompany you.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.460
Young Master!

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.180
Young Master!

00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.260
I'm fine!

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.540
Whose turn is it now?

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.020
The Princess Royal.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.220
Xiaoqian still refuses to do it?

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.460
Her Highness said

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.900
she'd come to see you in the costume

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.460
as soon as she finished.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.660
And she asked you to rest in bed.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.580
I know she doesn't want to leave me.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.420
But I can't let her stay because of me.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.940
Young Master, you vomited blood!

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.380
I don't want Xiaoqian to be alone

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.140
after I'm gone.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.140
Help me to get up.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.740
Your Highness!

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:00.940
I'm fine.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.180
I also want to walk this path.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.180
Offer incense to heaven!

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.940
What's the big deal?

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.540
What tale?

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.100
Your Highness!

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.180
It's only a lie!

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.740
There's no wise ruler or vision at all!

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.380
I did it!

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:15.820
People always said

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.300
that I couldn't.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.420
But look,

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.340
I walked through the path!

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.380
Maybe, it's because I had you by my side.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.020
Your Highness,

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.660
it's your turn.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.100
Succession ceremony begins now!

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.340
Wish Huayuan City

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.900
a prosperous and peaceful future!

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.460
The ceremony is held

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.460
over and over again.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.940
First it was the Second Princess,
then the Princess Royal.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.460
And now, it'll be

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.860
the Third Princess...

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.300
I think I'll pass.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.340
Qianqian, don't be willful.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.940
I really don't want to do it.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.860
What if

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.820
the door of heaven really opens?

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.660
Don't you want to be the next City Owner?

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.100
Whether I can be the City Owner or not

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.540
has nothing to do with
walking the flower path

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.500
or the vision.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.140
A wise and benevolent City Owner

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.340
doesn't need these things to prove herself.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.820
All she needs is

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.180
a kind and caring heart for people

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.580
to get their respect and support.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.100
Come up here!

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.380
Qianqian, come here!

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.700
Han Shuo!

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.100
You ran over here!

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.500
I told you to wait for me in your room.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.740

that she was right,

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.540
We don't have to deal with death.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.820
Just return to your world.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.860
Bai Ji, help Young Master to go back.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.420
Okay.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.220
Qianqian!

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.180
Qianqian!

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.580
Qianqian!

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.660
Han Shuo!

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.620
After suffering from all the hardships,

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.980
Chen Chuchu, the Second Princess of Huayuan
finally became the City Owner.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.180
During her succession ceremony,

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.860
an auspicious vision appeared –
the sun and the moon shone together in the sky,

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.500
the door of heaven opened,
surrounded by colorful clouds!

00:32:59.100 --> 00:32:59.740
The end.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.380
Was that really just a dream?

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.580
I woke up.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.820
Xiaoqian, when can you
finish altering the script?

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.620
Xiaoqian, I'm not pushing you.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.620
But can't you try to deliver the script
a couple of days earlier?

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.740
The super star, Mr. Han, is still waiting!

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.740
Listen, you've got to reflect

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.340
his advice in your alteration.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.460
So,

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.060
it really was a dream.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.540
Then Han Shuo

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.180
didn't exist?

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.260
(Check in Zone)

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.020
(Check in Zone)

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.060
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.260
I'm sorry,

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.980
but I may have to extend my deadline.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.300
Extend your deadline, why?

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.220
Because I lost my love.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.620
You've never even been in love!

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.980
How could you lose it?

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.780
I mean,

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.740
I do feel that there are some problems

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.980
with my story.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.740
I understand now why Mr. Han

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.140
asked me that question.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.340
I had no idea what love was before.

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.180
But now,

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.340
I think I do.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.540
Xiaoqian, don't worry.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.220
We actually have more time now,

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.620
and we won't film until three months later.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.500
Three months later?

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.020
Why?

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.380
Don't know what happened exactly,

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.220
but Mr. Han had a car accident

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.820
the night before last night.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.580
He was admitted to the hospital.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.380
How is he doing now?

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:37.620
Don't worry.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.940
He is quite lucky.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.260
The doctor said he only injured his lungs.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.140
He'll be able to get back to work

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.420
after resting for three months.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.380
Mr. Zhang, what hospital is it?

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.420
I wanna go check on him.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.540
Excuse me, could you tell me
where the inpatient department is?

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:08.780
Thank you!

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.100
I... I heard that you had a car accident.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.180
I'm fine now.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.580
I have to say

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.980
that the modern medical technology
is quite impressive.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.340
Should it happen in the ancient times,

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.420
I'd be dead.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.340
Do you still remember

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.260
how the accident happened?

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.660
It happened too fast.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.940
I only remember a strong beam of white light

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.740
and then nothing.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.780
Then do you still remember

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.260
playing fireworks in town
on the Double Seventh Festival?

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.740
It's not allowed to play fireworks
within the fifth ring road.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.460
No, I didn't mean the present day.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.300
Then do you still remember

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.100
that I stole the Dragon Bone for you
and cured your heart disease?

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.580
First of all, I was hit by a car.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:11.980
I didn't have

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.780
the heart disease you talked about.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:15.420
Second of all,

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.940
Miss Scriptwriter, if you stole something,

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.940
I suggest you turn yourself in
as soon as possible.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.940
You are not Han Shuo.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.580
Han Shuo?

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.580
Chuchu?

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.740
Chen Qianqian?

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:38.820
Miss orange.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.620
I'm in the hospital.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:40.980
Do we need to go over the script now?

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.100
Don't you think you immerse
too much in the story?

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.460
Sorry

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.420
to disturb you.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.340
Chuchu? Chen Qianqian?

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.060
Miss orange. I'm in the hospital.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.460
Do we need to go over the script now?

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.540
Don't you think you immerse
too much in the story?

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.060
Orange?

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:19.620
There wasn't orange
in the version I delivered...

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:23.980
He is Han Shuo!

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:32.660
Banana!

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.700
Why did you come back?

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.380
Stay away from me!

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.140
I'm warning you! Don't come over!

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.140
You don't know how scary it was!

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.420
Something strange hit me all of a sudden

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.020
and I had a long dream.

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.140
And now, my head is filled

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.060
with images like apple, banana, orange,

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.140
which weren't even part of my memory!

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.380
And all I can think about is you!

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.620
Do you understand me?

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.180
I don't know it was a dream or reality!

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.540
So you'd better stay away from me

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.460
and stop making trouble!

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.140
So silly!

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.340
Is it silly?

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:20.780
Yes.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.060
Orange?

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:52.780
Mr. Han

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.140
is such a workaholic!

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.820
The moment he woke up, he called
the scriptwriter over to discuss the play.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.580
So you really should feel

00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.540
excited about our new series.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.780
When you report it,

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.460
please write positive things about it.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.540
Don't forget how professional

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.380
and dedicated Mr. Han is!

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.380
Now, here.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:09.780
This way, please!

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.940
Don't push.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.220
Both of them are very dedicated!

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.100
They are discussing passionately
about the play!

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.340
Okay! Don't take pictures!

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.540
Stop taking pictures!

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.420
So,

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.740
today's interview is over!

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.860
(With Chen Qianqian's help,
Chen Chuchu finally succeeded the City Owner.)

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.380
(Han Shuo cleared the air with Chen Qianqian.
They ended up being a loving couple.)

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:17.700
