=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 17)

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.100
Where is Su Mu?

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.380
Why is Lu Peng here?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.020
I thought he married the Princess Royal.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.900
Yeah.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.420
Where is Su Mu?

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.820
Forget it.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.420
The Princess Royal ignored him.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.660
She sent people to invite
Su Mu from time to time.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.340
What are you talking about?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.980
Coquettish.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.660
A musician's manners.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.020
What's wrong with being a musician?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.540
You're a musician yourself.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.900
I'm different from him.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.300
The Princess Royal picked me.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.780
He only managed to use

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.060
his best musician's fame

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.580
to enchant her for a while.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.860
Now I've been engaged to her.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.220
And you're still pestering her.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700
She won't marry you.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.260
A musician

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.900
doesn't deserve her.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.340
She's a cripple who can't walk.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.140
She has no right to detest me.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.780
Dare you say that

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.540
again?!

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.140
I'm not saying it
just because you told me to.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.700
A musician

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.820
can't order me around.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.020
They are fighting.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.540
After I get married,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.900
I'll make you all fear me.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.220
The Princess Royal.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.300
I'll make the Princess Royal dote on me.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.980
Let me go.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.980
All those who stand in
the Second Princess's way

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.260
must die.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.900
Why are there still so many documents left?

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.660
The City Owner's job is so tiring.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.260
Take a rest if you are tired.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.260
We can read these documents another day.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.220
That won't do.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.540
Folk people have their problems

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.460
and situations.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.300
As the Crown Princess, I can't put them off.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.140
I know.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.220
I miss you too.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.180
The mangoes and...

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.460
This is tiresome.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.540
How come

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.580
every official

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.620
wrote crap?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.860
Have you finished carving the stamp?

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.740
Yes, I have.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.500
(I got it.)

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.260
The City Owner's job is so tiring.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.500
I have to handle government affairs

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.740
and guard against the hostile people
from Xuanhu City.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.860
Don't worry.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.260
As long as I'm here,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.220
Xuanhu City won't attack.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.540
This way is easier.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.580
Young Master, Your Highness.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.580
Lu Peng is dead.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.780
Dead?

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.780
He was found dead this morning

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.940
in an alley.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.740
I knew he was cannon fodder.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.180
Pushing him into the spotlight
incurred heaven's punishment.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.540
Wait.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.980
I thought Lu Peng's death

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.100
had disappeared from the plot.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.140
Why is the plot back on track?

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.220
Is the plot still moving forward?

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.900
Masters.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.020
Didn't you say

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.860
a lot of things in the plot wouldn't happen?

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.740
But that musician still died.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.900
You said

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.420
that musician was redundant.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.740
Now you sound like

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.260
you're reluctant to let him go.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.300
I'm worried about Banana.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.620
Have you noticed

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.260
that even though many things
in the plot didn't happen,

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.300
the fate of the characters had no change?

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.100
Banana didn't blow up the city.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.460
But Apple's mother still fell ill.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.980
Crooked Melon didn't kill.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.700
But that musician still died.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.820
I'm worried.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.420
I'm worried that Banana

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.100
will end up like he did in the plot I wrote.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.500
Then how did Banana

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.940
end up in the plot?

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.620
According to the Crown Princess,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.380
Apple destroyed Banana.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.260
What does destroy mean here?

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.820
Xuanhu destroyed Huayuan.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.700
Han Shuo spared Chuchu for their love.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.380
But he didn't know

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.460
Chuchu would build up her strength

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.900
and make a comeback with Su Ziying's help.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.740
The two of them eventually had a showdown.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.900
Bai Ji!

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.580
Bai Ji.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.180
Young Master.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.940
Forgive me for taking one step ahead.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.340
When you occupied Huayuan City
on the night of the Double Seventh Festival,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.540
did you predict

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.740
my return?

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.500
I shouldn't have spared you back then.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.500
Yes.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.900
That's your biggest mistake.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.940
Unfortunately,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.300
you have no chance to make amends.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.580
Under these circumstances,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.420
only one of us

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.500
can live.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.340
Banana

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.740
can't resist the beauty eventually.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.860
There's no beauty.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.500
He's nowhere near Apple right now.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.700
The process doesn't matter.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.260
What matters is the result.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.380
He won't confront Apple now.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.540
So he won't be stabbed in the heart.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.220
But I'm afraid.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.500
I'm afraid that he'll end up
like Orange's mother,

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.820
like that musician.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.660
He may be able to avoid the stab,

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.460
but he'll still have the same ending.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.820
If he really dies,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.980
what should I do?

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.180
It's inevitable.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.540
You designed him

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.500
as a tragic character in the first place.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.180
Lin Qi, also known as Crooked Melon,

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.540
killed Lu Peng to save her black stone mine

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.700
and framed Han Shuo for the murder.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.140
Crooked Melon.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.540
Have you done the job as I said?

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.180
I've paid the coroner

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.900
to confirm the cause of Lu Peng's death.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.460
We've secretly made a murder weapon
that matches the wound.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.860
But I don't understand

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.460
why you'd frame Han Shuo

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.020
for Lu Peng's death.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.740
Han Shuo

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.780
should be honored by Chuchu's affection.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.980
Who'd have thought that

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.180
he would love that useless Chen Qianqian?

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.340
He made Minister Pei so mad

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.500
that Minister Pei left the clan school.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.860
However,

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.300
Lu Peng died at the right time.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.500
I might as well seize the chance

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.140
to help Chuchu get even with him

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.620
and

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.980
teach Chen Qianqian a lesson.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.020
My lady,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.980
Han Shuo is the Young Master of Xuanhu City.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.700
Do you think the City Owner

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.340
will punish him for killing a musician?

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.980
Lu Peng was no ordinary musician.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.620
He was the Princess Royal's fiance.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.700
Even if Han Shuo doesn't die this time,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.620
he'll pay a grave price.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.060
And he'd better be thrown

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.540
into the Music and Dance
Academy as punishment,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.180
so I could discipline him.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.420
By then,

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.740
I'd like to see Chen Qianqian's face.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.380
Have you got the things ready?

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.580
The murder weapon
and physical evidence are ready.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.340
Once your order is given,

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.540
those things will be sent to
Young Master Han in Yueli Mansion.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.460
Good.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.780
Let's do as planned tonight.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.500
What are you planning to do tonight?

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.620
Chen Qianqian?

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.660
Why are you here?

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.820
I'm here to investigate a case.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.220
Lin Qi,

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.540
don't assume that I don't know

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.900
you killed Lu Peng.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.180
You even intended to frame Han Shuo.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.660
Chen Qianqian,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.180
it's true that the two of us

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.300
want each other dead,

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.860
but you shouldn't

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.620
blame me for everything.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.300
Quit making accusations without evidence.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.900
Where is your evidence?

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.260
Search this place.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:32.860
Yes.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.100
Don't move.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.180
The account book.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.700
The account book.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.460
(Musician Lu Peng of the Music
and Dance Academy was murdered)

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.700
One chi long and three cun wide.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.900
According to the Criminal Minister,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.740
it's the size of the weapon
used to kill Lu Peng.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.660
Why did you draw this?

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.540
Why did you draw this?

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.580
For customization.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.420
Keep on searching.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.380
Your Highness.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.580
How can you deny it now?

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:15.740
The murder weapon is here.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.700
I... I made it for my own use.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.540
That's right.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.220
It's for your own use.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.300
And you killed Lu Peng.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.260
Chen Qianqian, stop slandering me.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.340
Why would I kill Lu Peng

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.700
for no reason?

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.500
Why would I want to frame Han Shuo?

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.660
(Han Shuo)
The shingle.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.140
You even made the shingle.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.220
Are you waiting for Han Shuo
to hang out the shingle

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.100
at the Music and Dance Academy tomorrow?

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.820
You dare to touch my man.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.620
Arrest her.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.540
Chen Qianqian.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.580
The whole Huayuan City doesn't belong to you

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.300
even if Her Majesty
isn't taking charge.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.300
You are right.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.500
Huayuan City belongs to me now.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.260
You should know who Han Shuo is.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.660
How dare you touch him?

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.220
You won't get to frame Han Shuo.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.300
You have no regard for human lives.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.900
Take her away and lock her up.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.180
I'll decide her punishment.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.540
Chen Qianqian, I thought you changed.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.740
But you're still that rascal.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.100
You... You are settling the case?

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.660
Why don't you investigate first?

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.340
Those storytellers were right.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.860
Lin Qi really did it.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.860
Things didn't turn out

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.140
as the plot designed.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.140
I just didn't know

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.900
Lin Qi was playing tricks in the dark.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.300
Now I can rest easy.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.660
I heard

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.220
Chen Qianqian searched
the Music and Dance Academy.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.540
So I went there to watch the disturbance.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.780
Lin Qi?

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.340
What trouble has she caused this time?

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.180
Chen Qianqian found
the weapon used to kill Lu Peng

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.780
at Miss Lin Qi's place.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.220
Lin Qi

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.060
always does more harm than good.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.860
Everyone knows she is close to me.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.380
She shouldn't have interfered.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.500
If she isn't cautious enough,

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.780
she'll make me look suspicious.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.580
If the Lin family withdraws her statement,

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.260
the case will definitely
be investigated thoroughly.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.340
Maybe we should

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.860
prove Miss Lin Qi guilty

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.780
to close Lu Peng's case.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.300
Your Highness, it's just my idea.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.780
It has nothing to do with you.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.300
Lin Qi of the Music and Dance Academy

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.500
murdered the Princess Royal's fiance Lu Peng

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.180
and attempted to frame
the Crown Princess's husband Han Shuo.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.340
How are you going to handle the case?

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.580
Miss Lin Qi

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.580
is the only daughter
of the Lin family, after all.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.260
No matter who pleads for her,

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.420
I won't spare her.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.380
Even Chuchu can't change my mind.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.740
Please sentence Lin Qi

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.300
to death.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.620
Death?

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.020
Wait.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.260
I killed off Lin Qi in the plot.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.820
Sentencing her to death

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.020
only proves

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.260
that I can't change
the fate of the characters

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.500
even though I've changed the plot.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.140
Then Han Shuo will...

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.140
Must not die.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.460
Lin Qi must not die.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.820
Lin Qi has made mistakes.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.780
But considering the Lin family

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.820
has served Huayuan City for years,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.460
I'll spare her life for now.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.220
I handled the case on impulse yesterday.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.900
I didn't carry out a thorough investigation.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.740
We have testimony and physical evidence.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.020
What's the need for investigation?

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.700
Your Highness,

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.340
did Lin Qi attempt to frame Han Shuo?

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:00.940
Yes.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.460
Did Lin Qi's weapon

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.380
match the weapon used to kill Lu Peng?

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.260
Yes.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.980
As the Crown Princess,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.220
you surely can convict the owner

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.940
of the Music and Dance Academy.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.380
You've been friends
with Lin Qi for many years.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.180
You two even called
each other sisters yesterday.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.860
How come you want her dead today?

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.180
I'm judging the case as it stands.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.180
You're too emotional

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.820
while handling affairs.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.300
Shouldn't you be grounded?

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.820
Why are you here?

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.940
It concerns Lin Qi.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.940
To maintain Huayuan City's law,

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.220
of course I should set an example,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.180
lest you show mercy

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.180
to a criminal for my sake.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.540
You want her dead so badly?

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.940
Your Highness, make a decision.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.660
What should we do about Lin Qi?

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.140
Lin Qi, you have a visitor.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.860
Chuchu?

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.940
It must be hard for you

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.660
to come here to have a good laugh at me.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.500
You're

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.980
pampered, overweening,

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.140
and conditioned to act willfully.

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.300
Change yourself.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.740
Are you calling me willful?

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.260
Seriously?

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.860
Who snatched a groom on the street,

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.340
stole the Dragon Bone and
released the mountain bandits?

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.820
In terms of willfulness,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.820
nobody can surpass you,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.380
Chen Qianqian.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.820
I don't understand.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.820
Why have you always been playing against me?

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.660
Because you always play against Chuchu.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.500
You stole Chuchu's stuff.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.140
And I'll steal the stuff back for her.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.140
I know

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.300
you grew up with Chuchu.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.700
Compared to me, you are more like her sister.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.060
But you should know that

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.620
people can change.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.460
Bullshit.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.020
At this point,

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.300
you're still sowing discord.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.380
You think Chuchu is heartless like you?

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.380
Perhaps you killed Lu Peng

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.380
and framed me.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:07.860
Fine.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.260
Fine. I did it all.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.220
Maybe it can make you feel better.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.900
I

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.100
planned to sentence you to death.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.500
Chuchu kept begging me

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.220
to spare your life.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.380
Alright?

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.940
I knew it.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.500
Your life can be spared,
but you can't escape punishment.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.140
I'll banish you.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.300
To what place?

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.260
A good place.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.300
Xuanhu City.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.780
Xuanhu City?

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.460
Where men take charge?

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.700
You might as well kill me.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.740
With this golden token,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.900
you won't be stopped
by anyone in Huayuan City.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.580
You're banishing me to Xuanhu City.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.500
What's the use of
Huayuan City's golden token?

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.300
You think I'm stupid

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.580
and I should thank you?

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.060
Are you sure you don't want it?

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.940
Lin Qi,

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.100
you are getting banished.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.780
This is the most valuable thing
you could have.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.100
At least you can trade it for food.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.900
It's made of pure gold, after all.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.980
You don't want it?

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.420
Whatever.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:19.900
Stop!

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.940
Why hasn't Chuchu visited me?

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.540
I grounded her.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.100
She pestered me and pleaded for you
every day. It was so annoying.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:35.820
I'd rather not see her.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.060
Chen Qianqian! You jerk!

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.940
You... You should come at me.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.100
Set Chuchu free!

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.300
Let Chuchu go!

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.780
Chen Qianqian!

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.820
I've finally saved Lin Qi's life.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.300
As long as Lin Qi is safe,

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.580
Han Shuo should be safe.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.820
According to the original story line,

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.500
the ending is around the corner.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.340
If nothing happens

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.140
during this time,

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.460
everything is going to be fine.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.260
(I got it.)

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.500
Lately, it's been found that
the envoys of Xuanhu City

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.780
and their men have been lurking
on the borders of Huayuan City,

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.020
ready to make moves.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.020
Please take a decision as soon as possible.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.020
Xuanhu City's envoys haven't left.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.980
Did they know about
mother's critical illness?

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.380
What's on your mind?

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:01.860
Nothing.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.700
I know

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.300
you're stuck between
Xuanhu City and Huayuan City

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.860
and things are difficult for you.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.340
I'll send them a letter

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.340
to tell them that
Huayuan City has no weakness

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.540
and they shouldn't stay here for long.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.140
They'll be back soon.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.420
Don't worry.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.820
As long as I'm in Huayuan City,

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.340
the two cities won't make war

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.620
and the people won't live in misery.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.420
Will you always stay in Huayuan?

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.300
This question never crossed my mind.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.180
I was just asking.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.300
We can talk about our future later.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.980
We are like an ink pad and a stamp.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.780
Without the ink pad, the stamp

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.340
is an useless rock.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.380
Without the stamp, the ink pad

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.140
is an ordinary pigment.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.820
They are like you and me.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.500
They'd never separate.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.140
Your Highness.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.740
What's the matter?

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.180
It's late. Go to bed.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.660
Mind your own business.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.020
Stop paying attention to my sleep.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.340
Your Highness, I have important news
for the Young Master.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.300
No matter what it is, leave it for tomorrow.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.740
Nobody must disturb us here.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.620
Alright.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.620
Now,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.980
nobody will disturb us again.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.500
Let's

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.660
carry on.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.700
Your Highness.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.900
Your Highness, Miss Lin Qi has set off.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.500
As you ordered,

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.300
I have asked the City Guards
to take care of her on the way.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.540
You didn't have to tell me that.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.020
I'm not close to her.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.780
What's the deal now, my lady?

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:50.540
I can't keep on walking.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.940
We have not gone far.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.460
You'd spend ten days to complete
a three-day journey.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.540
You're going so slowly,

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.740
when will we arrive in Xuanhu City?

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.100
I'm not going.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.100
What can you do to me?

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.220
You two can go without me.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.460
It's okay. It's okay.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.460
She's just tired.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.540
We'll continue our journey after a rest.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.780
Release me from the shackles.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.900
If our superior hadn't

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.060
ordered us to take care of you,

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.700
we wouldn't have cared about your feelings.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.860
The Second Princess
ordered you to take care of me.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.580
So you have to take care of me.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.380
Otherwise, I'll write a letter to Chuchu

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.460
after arriving in Xuanhu City,

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.100
asking her to kill you two.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.220
The Second Princess?

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.260
The Second Princess wasn't
the person who ordered us.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:38.820
Yeah.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.060
Not Chuchu?

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.140
Is it the Princess Royal Yuanyuan?

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.260
It's the Crown...

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.260
Chen Qianqian?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.540
You are Chuchu's subordinate.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.020
I want to see Su Mu.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.660
Your Highness,

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.860
the Music and Dance Academy

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.500
is going through big changes

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.020
in utter chaos.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.780
Your timing is unfortunate.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.820
I want to see Su Mu.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.980
But we are closed.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.060
Do you want to drink?

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.220
Or do you want music?

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.020
We musicians of the Music and Dance Academy

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.020
are highly skilled

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.060
and able to serve you well.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.820
I waited for you in my mansion every day.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.540
You didn't show up.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.940
I had no choice but to come here
and look for you.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.980
I see. You want to have fun

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.300
in the Music and Dance Academy.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.580
You once said

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.860
the Music and Dance Academy's beauty

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.340
mostly manifested in you.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.860
The service of all musicians

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.220
couldn't outdo your hearty smile.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.020
Why would you rather have
other people keep me company

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.620
than smile at me?

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.100
I'm willing to serve

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.900
the dignitaries and nobles in Huayuan City.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.700
But I'm unwilling to associate

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.500
with you.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.060
Zi Nian.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.020
Escort the Princess Royal
back to her mansion.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:26.940
Your Highness.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.620
I'll be here tomorrow.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.980
If you don't change your mind,

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.100
I'll choose another one of these musicians

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.420
as my husband.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:54.660
We dare not marry you.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.220
Your Highness, please spare us.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.940
We dare not follow in Lu Peng's footsteps.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:35.660
What are you doing?

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.580
Extend your hand.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.900
I have something for you.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.380
What is it?

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.540
Me.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.420
I carved a new stamp for you.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.340
Heart-shaped.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.700
Good to see you smile.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.660
You've been feeling distraught these days.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.940
What happened?

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:20.860
Is it about

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.100
the City Owner's illness?

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.940
Or is it about the annoying
government affairs?

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:30.900
Maybe,

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.660
too many unforeseen events
have happened recently.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.540
Lu Peng died.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.820
But there's still a barrier

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.060
between Su Mu and Yuanyuan.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.860
I really don't understand.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.300
How nice it would be

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.980
if two people in a relationship
were open and honest.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.260
Why must they

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.540
make one-sided sacrifices

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.500
for each other's sake?

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.580
It only hurts them.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.180
If you really think so,

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.820
then let's make a deal.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.300
No matter what happens in the future,

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.540
you must not make decisions alone

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.700
like Su Mu.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.140
We should talk things out.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.660
If you make this deal with me,

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.340
I'll go with you and try
to talk some sense into Su Mu.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.780
Even if I have to tie him up

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.700
and put a blade on his neck,

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.700
I'll make him accept the marriage.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.900
I'll make this deal with you.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.260
We'll come up with solutions together.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.620
And I want you to promise me one thing.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.900
No matter what happens in the future,

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.660
we won't hide things from each other
or lie to each other.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.740
Okay?

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.660
Wait.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.020
(Do not disturb.)

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.220
Nobody will disturb us now.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.540
Your Highness!

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.180
(Do not disturb.)

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:53.620
Bad news! Lin Qi is dead!

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.260
Your Highness.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.460
The story is about to end.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.820
You can't change Banana's fate now.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.860
Banana was destined to die.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.500
If you wanted to change it,

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.660
you would need to start from the beginning.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.620
Start from the beginning?

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.820
I shouldn't have written the wedding scene
where the groom was taken.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:17.900
It's karma at work.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.180
But Orange

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.660
should have been dead long ago.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.300
She has lived to this day.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.540
Your Highness,

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.300
let's be honest,

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.060
is this Orange

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.340
still the same Orange?

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.700
I see.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.500
I set the trap.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.820
But now I'm involved.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.060
I've lost control of many aspects.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.420
To protect him

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.820
from his original fate,

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.780
I have to push him out.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.140
After all, the outsiders are the safest.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.700
I'll change Banana's fate.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.580
Then Banana will end
his part in the story earlier.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.780
It won't do.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.740
From Orange's perspective,

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.780
this story won't be a comedy anymore.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.060
Even in those so-called comedies,

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:15.420
reality always contradicts hopes.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.140
That's why people say
"great joy leads to sadness."

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.940
Even the happiest ending

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.020
can include happy tears.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.180
Tragedy and comedy

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.700
have always been sharing the same root.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.820
In that case,

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.900
Banana will only know

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.620
part of the truth.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.660
He'll hate Orange very much.

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.660
Yeah.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.100
When heaven is about to confer
a great responsibility on any Orange,

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.940
it'll remove Orange's skin and seed,

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.460
cut Orange into four pieces
and extract Orange's juice.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.180
Happiness only comes after suffering.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.620
It's the hardship

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.740
Orange must endure.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.140
Your Highness, where are you going?

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.700
I'll go find Pei Heng and Su Mu.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.060
The screenplay has been completed.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.460
It's time to bring in the actors.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:30.820
Your Highness.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.260
I need to adjust my mode.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.180
I'll be shooting a heart-breaking scene soon.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.220
Are you scared by what happened to Lin Qi?

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.140
You've been spacing out all day.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.740
Here.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.620
Calm your nerves.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.140
It's not about Lin Qi.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.260
It's about Yuanyuan and Su Mu.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.540
If I put myself in their shoes

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.220
as the Young Master

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.660
of Xuanhu City

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.260
who fell for a courtesan

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.460
and insisted on marrying her,

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.540
the people of Xuanhu City would judge me.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.220
Su Mu's concern

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.740
isn't groundless.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.860
He really is thinking for Yuanyuan,

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.460
fearing that others
might attack her for this.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:36.180
Since you know where the problem lies,

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.020
you should try to talk some sense into Su Mu.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.660
I made an appointment with him

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.220
in the tea house.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.380
Okay.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.740
I'll go there in your stead.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.740
And I'll visit mother
in the City Owner's mansion.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.340
Alright.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.620
Zi Rui.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.460
Your Highness.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.780
Let's go find Pei Heng.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.900
You're treating Young Master Han
like this again.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.380
Have you forgotten about the erotic pictures?

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.580
Actually,

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.100
it's not a big deal

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.220
seeking comfort from Mr. Pei secretly.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.500
After all, it's a mistake every woman makes.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.340
But you've got to toughen up.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.940
When Young Master Han found out,

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.380
you knelt on the ground right away.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.020
You even pulled me down with you.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.580
You weren't honorable at all.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.660
Weak legs don't matter.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.780
I'm afraid things
will be different this time.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.740
He'll not only scold me,

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.620
but also take a blade to kill me.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.100
Qianqian, you wanted to see me?

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.980
Pei Heng, I need to ask you a favor.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.140
I'd do anything for you.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.340
Mr. Su, sorry for keeping you waiting.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.900
I just arrived.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.300
Where is the Crown Princess?

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.700
She's taking care of the City Owner.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.180
And she couldn't leave for now.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.580
So she asked me to come in her stead.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.880
After you.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.700
Thank you.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.900
Who's in that room?

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.100
Young Master Han and Su Mu.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.420
Your Highness, you should go back.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.140
He still refused to see me?

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.300
It's not that Mr. Su refused to see you.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.220
He went out to meet Young Master Han

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.780
and didn't return the whole night.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.060
He didn't return the whole night?

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:03.460
Yeah.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.380
Where can he be?

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.740
We musicians

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.340
have nowhere to go

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.500
except the Music and Dance Academy.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.780
I hope that he hadn't ended up like Lu Peng.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.060
Su Mu has gone missing?

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.900
The Criminal Minister is on this case.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.860
The last victim Lu Peng

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.220
also came from the Music and Dance Academy.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.020
I have a feeling that he
has been sexually assaulted.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.780
Who did it

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.340
before I could do it?

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.060
(Man Lost)
My dear Mr. Su.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.380
Still worrying about Su Mu?

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.220
It's my fault.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.140
After meeting him in the tea house yesterday,

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.300
I didn't send him back to
the Music and Dance Academy.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.820
I'm a little scared.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:06.980
Of what?

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.060
Mother had an accident
and slipped into a coma.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.980
Su Ziying attempted to harm me,

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.420
but then disappeared.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.460
Lu Peng walked on the street

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.980
until his throat was cut open.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.980
Not to mention Lin Qi.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.900
Huayuan City hasn't been peaceful lately.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.660
The City Guards are controlled by Chuchu.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.940
You can't stay with me around the clock.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:32.660
When you aren't with me,

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.140
who will keep me safe?

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.780
Don't think wildly.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.500
I've sent people

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:39.940
to investigate Su Mu's case.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.580
Did you bring some shadow guards

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.780
when you came from Xuanhu City?

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.260
Are you using them
to probe and pass on messages.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:51.740
Bai Ji.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.180
Why do you guard against me?

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.060
I'm not asking the Young Master

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.340
for the guards.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:04.860
I can let you have them.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:05.900
It's just...

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.900
It's just I don't know Kung Fu

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.340
to protect myself right now.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.740
If I knew Kung Fu,
I wouldn't be afraid of robbers and bandits.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:14.940
If they dared come,

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.260
I'd take their lives.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.140
Unfortunately,

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.540
one cup of poisoned wine

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.220
dissolved my Kung Fu which I had
been practicing for over ten years.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.340
Young Master, this isn't wise.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.220
(Xuanhu)

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:08.660
This is your...

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.460
This is the only token
that can order my guards.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.660
They'd risk their lives
to protect the token's owner.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:19.860
Now

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.260
it's yours.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.220
For real?

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.980
I asked you for it and you just gave me.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:40.980
The guards

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.140
are your only trump in Huayuan City.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.660
Now you let me have this token.

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.700
What if... What if I don't deserve it?

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.260
Of course you do.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.580
I gave you my possessions and life.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.140
But I don't hear anyone calling me husband.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.060
Husband.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.420
What did you call me?

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:10.860
Alright.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.220
Let's go find Su Mu.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.620
I'm worried about him.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.860
Only by pushing Han Shuo out
of the story completely,

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.940
can I save his life.
