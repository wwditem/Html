=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 4)

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.900
She wasn't hitting you

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.340
but me.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.580
Your Highness, don't mind it.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.860
It didn't hurt when she whipped me.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.140
But if

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.620
you're angered,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.260
my heart

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.740
will ache.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.740
Don't! Don't!

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.020
Please don't be like this!

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.300
I know you are reluctant to stay
at the Music and Dance Academy.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.700
And you are tired of putting on
a fake smile every day.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.500
From now on,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.740
you don't have to play up to me.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.380
Just see me as your friend.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.340
I can't take your flirting anymore.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.780
How could I dare do that?

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.820
I'm just a musician

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.900
with low status.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.380
I dare not

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.420
befriend Your Highness.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.980
But you didn't choose to be a musician.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.220
If possible,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.700
who wouldn't want to be

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.900
born in a noble family

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.540
and enjoy a wealthy life like Pei Heng?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.340
After all, it's my fault.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.340
Your Highness, please don't blame yourself.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.100
The small wounds are no big deal.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.140
But as for these rewards,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.700
I

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.700
no longer dare receive.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.980
Zi Rui,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.700
if you go back,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.820
Lin Qi may give you a hard time again.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.060
But I belong to the Music and Dance Academy.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.860
I've decided to give you the gifts,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.340
how can I take them back?

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.420
No.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.860
I have to talk to Lin Qi!

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.940
Your Highness!

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.100
The Crown Princess Election will take place soon.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.860
It's better to avoid unnecessary trouble.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.420
If Her Majesty blames you for...

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.620
I don't care about
the Crown Princess Election at all!

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.700
Your Highness!

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.380
Well...

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.580
Chen Qianqian will like that?

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.820
After all, you two were brought together
because of a horse.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.300
Makes sense.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.900
(Yueli Mansion)
Since she likes me,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.500
she'll be happy

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.660
with whatever I give to her.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.020
Young Master Han.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.380
Is the Third Princess inside?

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.460
Young Master.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.660
Su Mu was just here.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.380
Then Her Highness and he rushed

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.660
to the Music and Dance Academy together.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.980
The Music and Dance Academy?

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.220
Young Master.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.380
You just said that she was in love with you.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.860
Then why would she go to the Music
and Dance Academy?

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.780
When women misbehave,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.780
you need to correct them.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.100
Right! That's right!

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.740
You want to buy Su Mu?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.020
Yes.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.100
Tell me,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.940
why?

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.620
For him,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.420
you not only come to the Academy frequently,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.300
but also wanna buy him
so that you can see him every day.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.940
You already have

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.020
Han Shuo in your mansion, don't you?

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.820
He's not good enough?

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.780
I want to buy Su Mu,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.140
not because I want him to entertain me,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.820
but because he doesn't want
to stay at the Academy.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.660
I redeem him so that he can
get his freedom back.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.020
As for Han Shuo,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.020
would you stop working against him

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.740
because of me?

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.340
He's not a pushover as you think.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.060
He's good at Kung Fu and tactical skills.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.620
He's just suffering from
heart disease right now.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.940
Don't always look down upon him.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.300
Who do you think

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.100
would want to be a musician here?

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.860
Don't pretend to be nice.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.700
With Su Mu's reputation,

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.780
where else can he go?

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.060
Without you by his side,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
anybody can bully him.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.100
Where can he go?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.020
I've had a place for him.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.700
Anyway,

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.300
it's none of your business.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.980
Thanks!

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.500
Young Master.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.980
Su Mu is just a musician.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.140
Why is the Third Princess willing
to offend the Lins for him?

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.340
This rumored the Third Princess

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.220
is getting more and more interesting.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.420
More and more interesting?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.060
What do you mean?

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.300
She could apologize to me that night,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.300
it shows she isn't as arrogant
and bossy as the rumor says.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.740
In fact, she's quite cute.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And today, she was able to
come up with a line for the poem,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.780
which means she's not
as illiterate as people think.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.260
She is now trying to save Su Mu,

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.100
so she's not a heartless person as we heard.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.020
She's actually nice and kind.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.300
When you think about it, it's really true.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.020
The Third Princess only asked for a musician.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.580
Yet Lin Qi refused her.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.180
Then I'll make all the musicians

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.900
around Lin Qi disappear.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.580
So, should we kill the musicians

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.660
or set the Academy on fire?

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.700
Your Majesty.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.060
the Third Princess is young

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.900
and in good health.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.060
But I have heart problems,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.500
and I won't live long.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.020
I feel so sorry.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.940
Your Majesty, I hope you can give an order

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.820
to send all musicians of the Academy

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.780
to the Third Princess's mansion

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.940
to play music and sing for her,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.620
so that she won't be lonely.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.260
Young Master Han,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.380
you should talk to the Third Princess.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.700
How can we send all musicians

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.340
to Yueli Mansion?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.140
I know I don't have many days left.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.980
I can't accompany Her Highness all the time.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.780
As long as Her Highness is happy,

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.660
even if I die someday,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.780
I won't have any regrets!

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.260
Since you've made your mind,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.620
I'll grant your request.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.980
From this day on,

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.940
the musicians of the Academy

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.660
will move to Yueli Mansion.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.860
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.060
Your Highness, about this matter...

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.820
Your Highness!

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.860
I thought you only had Su Mu in your heart.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.260
But, I was brought here, too.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:40.940
Stop!

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.780
I...

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.340
I...

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.860
Your Highness!

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.140
What's going on?

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.140
I heard it was an order from Her Majesty.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.780
We'll belong to Yueli Mansion from now on.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.300
Greetings to Your Highness!

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.980
Miss Lin Qi!

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.540
Miss Lin Qi, you are so generous!

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.780
You didn't want the money,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.820
and now,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.220
your business is banned!

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.700
You...

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:17.980
She'll hit me!

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.580
I... I hit you?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.660
Miss Lin.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.660
What?

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.100
Came to Yueli Mansion to make trouble?

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.340
She's Her Majesty's daughter.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.380
I'm fine if she strong-arms me.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.300
But who do you think you are?

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.780
How dare you to challenge me?

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.660
I remember

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.260
that you used to use whip, too.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.740
Never mind!

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.940
That was ancient history already.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.580
Having you is good enough for me now.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.860
Catch!

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.060
Fine!

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.900
Yueli Mansion!

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.940
I'll remember what you did to me today!

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.060
Lin Qi!

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.020
You can take the other musicians back.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.620
I only want Su Mu.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Your Highness.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.780
Young Master Han even

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.780
lowered himself for these musicians.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.780
And now,

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.300
people all say that you two, as a couple,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.740
one dares to ask,

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.580
and the other dares to take.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.460
He sacrificed so much for you.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.940
So, just keep

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.460
these musicians to yourself.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.540
You asked my mother

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.700
to send these musicians here?

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.180
And you also

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.820
lowered yourself?

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.180
As a woman,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.620
why did you ask that?

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.980
You didn't feel embarrassed to tell,

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.460
why would I feel embarrassed to hear?

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.260
I...

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.220
Your Highness!

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.260
Where should I accommodate so many people?

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.580
(Accumulate achievements
to influence the descendants)

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.900
Young Master, greetings to you!

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.020
Rise.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.260
Young Master is indeed clever!

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.940
You came up with this idea,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.460
so that I could see you with no trouble.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.020
But...

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.900
Sorry that I'm incompetent.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.780
I've spied in Huayuan City for years,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.940
but still haven't found the Dragon Bone.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.620
However, my clients

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.060
are all high-ranking officials and noblemen.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.220
About how much money in the treasury,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.100
how many troops and provisions
the City Guards own,

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.620
even the health condition of the City Owner,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.300
I know them all!

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.260
Young Master, what do you want to ask?

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.460
Just go ahead and ask me!

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.980
What did Chen Qianqian do

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.020
when she visited the Academy before?

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.940
Young Master!

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.060
I heard

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.980
that the Second Princess

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.740
took all the musicians away.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.580
What?

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.180
I just heard that.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.340
(If anything untoward should happen to me,
the Second Princess Chuchu would be the City Owner.)

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.540
Forget about the writing.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.860
Chuchu has become

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.540
so lazy recently.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.060
She hangs out with the people of
the Music and Dance Academy every day.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.780
That'll only diminish her.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.740
It's such a waste
that I've done so much for her.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.220
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.020
I heard that the Third Princess
has been very well behaved.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.460
Even the only musician in her mansion

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.500
will be sent away soon.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.620
Is that so?

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.100
It appears
that she's doing it for Young Master Han.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.780
Young Master,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.940
why did you give all the musicians

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.420
to the Second Princess, except for Su Mu?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.100
So that our spies

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.380
can continue to do their job.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.980
Young Master is indeed clever!

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.980
I thought

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.980
you wanted to make
the Third Princess look good,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.700
so you sent the musicians
to the Second Princess

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.300
to ruin her reputation.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.140
But no matter what,

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.220
you got Su Mu for the Third Princess,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.060
she must be thankful for you.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.860
I heard

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.060
that she spent a lot of money
on a Guqin.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.420
I think it's a gift for you.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.740
She rarely does things particularly for me.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.780
When she comes later to drop off the gift,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.220
we need to act surprised

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.940
to make her feel good.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.580
And don't tell her

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.620
that I don't play Qin.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.860
You are so thoughtful, Young Master!

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.420
Young Master!

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.700
Your Highness!

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:42.860
Young Master is over here!

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.820
Morning!

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.340
And?

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.660
And?

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.540
I heard you cough.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.300
Take good care and drink more warm water.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.060
Do you think Pei Heng will like this Qin?

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.180
Of course not.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.060
He hates playing the Qin.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:16.700
Don't you remember

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.700
that when you were little,

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.620
in order to show the power
of the women in Huayuan,

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.020
he was asked to play the Qin on site

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.580
at the feast of every festival?

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.500
So, he...

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.500
So, it has

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.140
left a scar on his heart?

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.180
That's right.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.580
No wonder he hates me so much.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.980
Then I should really give him this Qin.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.020
Bai Ji.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.780
Whom did you say

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.700
this Qin was for?

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.060
Please give me another chance

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.060
to fix my mistake!

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.300
You...

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:52.980
You know

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.620
that I never liked Qin.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.980
Really?

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.940
You can fool others,

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.180
but not me.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.700
Playing the Qin can help you
express your feelings.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.980
It's your favorite hobby.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.620
The Qin I brought to you
was made by a great master.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.060
The best Qin should be played
by the best player.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.340
Listen to me.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.020
You need to stick to what you like.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.660
I'm happy if you are happy.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.100
I know

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.500
people all think

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.140
that only musicians like
to play the Qin to please women.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.420
You don't want people
to think of you that way,

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.700
so you'd rather not play.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.020
And you pretend
that you don't like it at all,

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.620
because you don't want to be a pleasing tool.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.140
A knowledgeable,

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.660
righteous, smart and talented

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.980
person like you,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.500
shouldn't care too much

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.260
about what people think.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.220
Actually,

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.860
Su Mu is just like you.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.420
He doesn't want to stay at the Academy...

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.860
It's okay!

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.100
Just think about it.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.500
No matter you'll keep Su Mu or not,

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.740
I hope you can stick to your heart

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.660
and do what you want to do.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.500
How was it?

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.700
Has he made a decision?

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.420
Has Minister Pei said yes?

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.380
Your Highness.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.860
I'm already very thankful

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.660
for your thoughtfulness.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.620
If you

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.180
can go to the Academy

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.020
to visit me every now and then in the future,

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.540
that'll be good enough for me.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.900
Pei Heng will let you stay!

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.100
Chen Qianqian!

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.380
Did you force him to play again?

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.100
Don't you feel ashamed?

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.500
Stay away from Minister Pei!

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.340
Qianqian!

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.580
I thought you went to meet your bosom friend.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:06.980
What?

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.540
You hurt your arm from playing the Qin?

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.220
Can't believe you are mocking me
while I'm in pain.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.420
Your arm is dislocated.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.020
I need to reset your arm.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.460
When I pop it in place, it'll hurt a little.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.500
Hang in there.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.780
Hurt?

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.180
Hurt?

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.460
Your Highness, don't you remember?

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.460
The Third Princess began to
practice Kung Fu from an early age.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.900
She fell from a horse when she was seven,

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.300
fell from a roof when she was ten.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.620
She even broke her legs more than once,

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.020
and she never complained.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.060
So, there's no way that
this little arm problem will hurt her!

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.540
I remember.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.580
Your Highness, don't worry!

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.220
Just go ahead

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.580
and reset her arm,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.020
no matter how hurt it'll be.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.220
Zi Rui, you know me so well!

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.180
Good for you!

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.260
Of course!

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.340
Then I'll start now.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:06.980
Hold on!

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.660
Will you please say something

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.260
to distract me?

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.620
Though I'm fat,

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.780
I'm still afraid of pain!

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.140
What... What are you doing?

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.020
I've sent them out.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.980
Are you sure you can do this?

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.220
I'm your husband. You don't trust me?

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.900
How's that relevant to this?

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.020
When we first met,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.300
you were in red dress and looked so gorgeous.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.380
Even though your horse was out of control
and you almost fell,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.140
you stayed calm and came through.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.660
Your bravery in crisis

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.060
made me fall in love with you right away.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.940
I vowed that I'd marry nobody but you.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.940
I know

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.940
that you love me deeply.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.300
I feel the same to you.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.020
Isn't that "Humph" a little too careless?

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.340
Who said I was careless?

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.500
Done!

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.860
It's done?

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.060
So,

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.460
you only said those things

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.860
to distract me.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.020
That's why you talked nonsense.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.780
Since you are so afraid of pain,

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.660
why have you been

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.460
pretending that you were not?

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.660
I am not!

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.500
It's not quite done yet.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.460
I need to readjust a bit.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.820
No! Stop it!

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:18.860
I am afraid.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.700
I am.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.700
I had to pretend
because of the tough situation.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.100
I'm the Third Princess, after all.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.900
Since Zi Rui believes that I'm not afraid,
I'll go with it.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.140
You are so nosy!

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.580
You can all come in now!

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.580
Why did Lin Qi

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.020
strike a surprise attack on me?

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.260
Because she knew she couldn't defeat me!

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.340
We've had so many fights
since we were little.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.820
I've never been defeated.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.100
After I'm recovered,

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.740
I'll go teach her a lesson!

00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.420
Yuanyuan,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.540
how long will it take for me to recover?

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.980
Young Master did a good job.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.420
With your health condition,

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.140
you are fine already.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.260
Already!

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.140
Al...

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:13.780
Your Highness,

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.500
I'll go invite Miss Lin Qi right now.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.380
Wait!

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.060
Forget it!

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.540
I'm the daughter of Her Majesty.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.220
I'll be a bigger person.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.020
I won't make a big deal out of it.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.500
Zi Rui,

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.460
do you remember

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.620
that my mother taught us to work hard.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.340
The Crown Princess Election
is right around the corner.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.980
I'd rather spend time on study

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.260
than waste time on her!

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.340
Don't you think?

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.420
I'm letting her off.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.460
Young Master,

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.700
the new spies are in place already.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.780
We are investigating around the city

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.820
into who made the bamboo tube.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.060
I'm sure we'll find out

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.420
who was behind it soon.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.060
One more thing.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.620
The spy we once put in the Academy

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.380
found out something after

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.060
he was sent to the Second Princess's mansion.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.700
He wants to talk to you in person.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.180
Do you have time to meet him now?

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.660
I'll hit you!

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.820
Chen Qianqian, how come you are so cute?

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:36.700
Young Master?

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.540
Sure, bring him here.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.580
Yes.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.540
So cute!

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.820
Thank you for your compliment, Young Master!

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.220
(Accumulate achievements
to influence the descendants)

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.220
Young Master, greetings to you!

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.780
What's the emergency?

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.460
I suddenly remembered a secret rumor.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.260
Maybe it'll help you to get the Dragon Bone.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.060
Tell me.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.860
The Second Princess Chen Chuchu
isn't Her Majesty's real daughter.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.020
What?

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.940
Chen Chuchu isn't her real daughter?

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.220
And Chen Yuanyuan is disabled.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.780
So, Chen Qianqian will be

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.900
the only successor of Huayuan City!

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.300
Young Master,

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.820
if we poison Chen Qianqian,

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.980
Her Majesty will certainly save her
with the Dragon Bone.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.420
That'll be our chance to take it,

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.220
and your heart disease will be cured finally!

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.180
Then...

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.700
What about Chen Qianqian?

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.580
Chen...

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.420
The Dragon Bone can only save one person.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.180
Chen Qianqian will die for sure.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.340
Based on what I heard,

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.940
Her Majesty already had a sign of stroke.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.060
If

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.660
she knows that her favorite daughter
died a violent death,

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.220
she'll be destroyed,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.380
and Huayuan City will become leaderless.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.580
By then,

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.580
you'll be recovered,

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.860
and we'll have no worries at all.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.460
We can swing south and conquer Huayuan.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.620
And the black stone mine in Huayuan...

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.700
Young Master!

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.020
Smelting is the foundation
of our Xuanhu City.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.100
Black stone mine
is extremely important to us!

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.220
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.820
You have to make a decision!

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.860
I need more time to think about it.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.300
We can't rush it.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.940
We can't rush it.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.820
We can't rush it.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.700
Here you go.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.140
Naughty!

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.380
-Again! -Do it again!

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.140
How's your arm?

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.540
My arm? It's fine now!

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.780
Han Shuo cured me.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.260
Good to know!

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.900
The fruits were just delivered

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.220
from Xuanhu City.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.900
I brought some for you.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.940
Then I have to eat now.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.420
In case Han Shuo sees them.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.860
I can ask the servant to give him some, too.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.060
You don't understand.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.580
I'm worried that he'll be homesick

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.700
if he sees the fruits from his hometown.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.980
I'm being inconsiderate.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.780
Young Master Han lives in Huayuan alone.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.940
He must be very sad.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.540
Not necessarily.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.620
He only has the Dragon Bone in his mind.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.100
Have a good night's sleep.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.140
I'll visit you again in a few days.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:11.900
Okay!

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.180
Young Master.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.620
Your Highness.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.540
I saw that Young Master Han just left,

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.060
and he seemed unhappy.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.180
Oh, no!

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.620
Maybe he heard me!

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.220
He must have been jealous.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.780
Before, when you

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.700
broke your arm or leg,

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.460
Minister Pei never visited you.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.780
And now it was just a shoulder dislocation.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.580
That's because of the friendship
between teacher and student.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.580
The friendship between teacher and student.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.660
If we poison Chen Qianqian,

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.900
Her Majesty will certainly save her
with the Dragon Bone.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.540
Hey,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.900
Han Shuo stays in our mansion,

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.700
so he's one of us.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.540
We should have him

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.900
feel like home.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.060
Your Highness, you mean...

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.420
How about we hold a birthday party for him?

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.620
Young Master's birthday date is a top secret.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.020
How can we find out?

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:24.940
You know what?

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.220
About Han Shuo's birthday date,
five elements and eight characters,

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.300
horoscope and blood type,

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.220
I know them even better than his mom!

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.900
Look at you!

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:40.860
You useless jerk!

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.260
I'll teach you a lesson when we are home!

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.100
Hurry!

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:43.940
Listen,

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.020
eating one onion every day

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.380
will guarantee you a daughter.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.500
So your mother-in-law
won't abuse you anymore.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.420
Really?

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.180
Of course!

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.100
Take it.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:51.860
Five coins.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.540
The vegetables are here.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:53.060
Just these two.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.220
Look! Look!

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.020
He's exposing his legs in public!

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.260
How shameless!

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.620
How shameless!

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.020
He should make a living
in the Music and Dance Academy!

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.140
So embarrassing!

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.620
If he is taken advantage of,

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.180
he should only blame himself!

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.500
-He deserves it! -That's right!

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.500
-He deserves it! -Let's go!

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.460
What do you think

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.980
we should give to Han Shuo?

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.060
Why don't you ask your advisers?

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.140
They are only interested

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.380
in talented scholars and pretty ladies.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.260
Their ideas will only be limited to
handkerchief, fan, sachet or jade pendant.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.300
Too old-fashioned!

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:21.820
I heard

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.860
that women in Xuanhu City

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.020
would make shoes
and socks for their husbands.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.620
Shoes?

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.580
Men always love shoes!

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:32.980
Then I'll buy shoes for him.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.100
Is there a custom shop?

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.300
Yes.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.420
Please come again.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:39.940
Okay!

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.740
Introduce some clients to me! Take care!

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.740
Warning! Be careful!

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.140
Pack up the stall! Quick!

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.420
Well... What are they hiding from?

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.580
The city patrol is here?

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.260
You never paid when you bought things.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.820
We owe money to the entire street.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.700
They are hiding from me?

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.380
Because they don't have manners.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.100
I will give you money, alright?

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.020
We'll pay cash!

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.740
Open your doors!

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.540
Come to my shop! Come on!

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.540
Your Highness, take a look!

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.140
I have some new calligraphy and paintings.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.900
Your Highness, we have new cloth!

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.660
Come on! Take a look!

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:26.780
Your Highness!

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.660
Come and take a look at our lanterns.
We have multiple colors.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.020
You only have cages, but no birds, right?

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.140
Your Highness, what do you want to buy?

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:34.980
Come in and take a look!

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.020
If there's anything you like,
we'll deliver it to your mansion.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.140
We have a lot of stuff.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.100
Take a look inside.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.140
Please, come in!

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.580
You are back!

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.540
Are you worried that I collude with Xuanhu

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.820
and exchange letters?

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.900
Would you believe me if I told you

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.340
that the bamboo tube started it?

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.260
You must be kidding.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.540
Now, forget it.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.020
I'm here for a reason.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.380
Close your eyes.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.900
Did I do anything

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.220
that made you mad,

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.860
so that you want to get rid of me?

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.380
No!

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.260
It's not like what you thought.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.340
I kinda wish that you were here to kill me.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.260
What did you say?

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.220
I'm not in the mood to joke.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.500
I see that you've been upset
these couple of days.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.780
Is it because of me?

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.700
No.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.780
How do I measure his chest and waist?

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.820
I want to kill her,

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.220
but she is so innocent

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.740
that she's even hugging me?

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.460
Okay! I'm good now! Bye!

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.380
The Third Princess

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.860
really liked the cloth

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:32.900
that your shop delivered.

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.500
We'll buy from your shop again.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.900
I also brought

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.420
something else this time.

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:39.460
A few days ago,

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.580
you asked us

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.220
to make a custom-made sealing wax bamboo tube.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.540
My boss said

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.300
the Third Princess never
ordered anything in small amount,

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.660
so we made 500.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.780
The extra 499

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.300
will be given to the Third Princess

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.820
for free.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:54.500
Alright.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.060
Then I'll take them
on behalf of the Third Princess.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:56.620
Okay.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.580
Now, you guys,

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.780
take them to the kitchen in the back yard.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.100
See you!

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:00.940
Okay.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:01.860
Careful!

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.580
(Accumulate achievements
to influence the descendants)

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.580
If we poison Chen Qianqian,

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.900
Her Majesty will certainly save her
with the Dragon Bone.

You finally smiled!

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:55.220
Happy birthday to Young Master Han!

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.260
Happy birthday!

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.220
Today is my birthday?

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.860
How did you know that?

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.900
Not only do I know your birthday date,

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.380
I also know you are 186cm in height,

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.820
you weigh 75 kg,

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:12.940
your blood type is O.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.180
You like black,

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.740
don't like rainy days,

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.300
your favorite food is noodle soup
cooked by your mom,

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.580
you don't like ginger.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.620
What else do you know?

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.420
I also know

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.340
that when you were born,

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.700
everyone in Xuanhu City

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.900
said that you'd be a rarely-seen prodigy.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.900
But unfortunately, when you were 16,

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.620
you were diagnosed with heart disease.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.660
The doctors said

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.260
that you would die before 20.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.300
Ever since then,

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.780
your character has changed.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.700
What would the life be like

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.100
for a man who knows when he'll die?

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.660
It's like countdown every day.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.260
You blame God for his unfairness.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.980
You hate that you can't change your fate.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.620
You want to live.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.620
So you'd rather do anything

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.220
as long as you can cure your disease.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:16.740
Han Shuo,

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.780
trust me,

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.980
there's one person who can cure you,

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.020
and she'll be the one who loves you the most.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.780
So, don't give up!

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.220
You have to stick it out to the end!

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.500
When people learned

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.260
that I would die before 20,

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.220
they all tried to comfort me,

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.500
as if I were already dead.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.740
But you actually believe that I can be saved.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.900
Because you didn't meet me before.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.340
Why do you give me that look again?

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.860
You've been upset for days.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.020
You looked much better
when you smiled just now.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.220
Does it matter

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.620
whether I smile or not?

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.860
Of course, it does.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.180
If a beauty doesn't smile under the moon,

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.460
then the staggering night view

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.500
will be a waste.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:21.940
Sounds like

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.580
Your Highness wants to
spend the night with me.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.860
I am spending the night with you
right now, aren't I?

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.940
It's hotpot.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.380
Young Master, please.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.620
No matter what is bothering you,

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.740
nothing cannot be solved by one hotpot meal.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.420
If there is,

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.980
then have two hotpot meals!

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.460
What kind of theory is that?

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.100
This is the law of hotpot!

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.340
The second rule of this law

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.220
is that if you want to test

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.100
a person's real heart,

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.220
then you can see if she'll give you

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.460
the first thing she cooked.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.860
This is the first thing I cooked.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.140
I'll give it to you.

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.820
I have heart disease.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.140
I can't eat spicy things.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:15.940
It's okay.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.180
I like spicy food. I can eat it.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.420
Luckily, I prepared double-flavor hotpot.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.860
Look the spicy soup and the non-spicy soup.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.180
They have completely different flavors,

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.540
yet they are put in the same pot.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.300
Since you like spicy food,

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.740
wouldn't it be better

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.100
if you got a spicy hotpot?

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.740
In that case,

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.180
you can't eat any.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.060
Plus,

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.620
the fun part about having hotpot
is eating it together.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.100
As the so-called "Seek agreement
while shelving differences,"

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.300
people with different opinions

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.740
can certainly get along.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.820
Double-flavor hotpot
must include two flavors.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.180
Neither of the two can be missing.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.300
Neither of the two can be missing.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.700
Come on, start eating.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.820
If you don't eat,

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.060
I'll have them all.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.940
Oh, I see!

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.540
You want wine, right?

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.460
I've prepared fruit wine.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.980
I know with your heart condition,
you can't drink wine.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.180
But the fruit wine

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.700
contains very little alcohol,
it won't make you drunk.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.740
It's a special day today,

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.700
I'll drink a little, too.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.620
Toast to you!

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:34.220
Okay!

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.900
Cheers, Your Highness!

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.620
Can't believe

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.340
that we can sit here and drink together.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.060
Here.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.060
Banana,

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.100
let me toast to you again!

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.860
Thank you for sparing the orange's life!

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.260
Cheers!

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.460
Don't worry.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.580
You have me.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.260
I won't watch you die.

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.780
There must be a miracle!

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.140
If there's not, I'll create one!

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.500
In fact, I've found a way to cure my disease.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:45.980
But I don't want to use that.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.580
The Third Princess

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.060
