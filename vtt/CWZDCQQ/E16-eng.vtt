00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.780
Your Majesty!

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.740
Han Shuo, don't!

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.500
Don't move.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.780
Don't move.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.300
Stop!

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.900
Your Majesty, look.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.620
On the Young Master's order,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.180
I set off the fireworks
for the Crown Princess.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.500
You have no right to arrest me.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.380
Fireworks?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.580
Of course.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.900
What else can they be? Explosives?

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.660
You people of Huayuan City
aren't romantic at all.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.660
Fireworks.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.980
Your Highness.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.860
The things laid in various places
of the city are fireworks,

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.940
not explosives.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.220
Sangqi.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.420
Where is Xuanhu City?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.460
It's located to the north of our city.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.740
Your Majesty, why did you do that?

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.500
I should thank the City Owner of Xuanhu

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.100
for sending a great commander to me.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.980
Han Shuo has been ruined by Qianqian.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.140
He'll serve Huayuan City from now on.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.460
It's because you've raised a good daughter.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.100
Forget it.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.980
My children's marriages

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.740
only concern themselves, after all.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.940
They can be with

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.580
whoever they want.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.620
Fireworks.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.220
It's wonderful to see

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.660
you change your mind.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.380
If our City Owner learns about this,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.580
he will also...

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.980
The tea is...

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.220
Tell the others

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.460
not to make any move

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.100
without my order.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.380
Young Master,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.900
by doing this,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.820
you have disobeyed our City Owner's order.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.900
If Chen Qianqian didn't love me,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.420
I'd treat her much better

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.460
to make her love me.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.540
But if I killed her mother

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.140
and destroyed Huayuan City,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.700
she'd never forgive me.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.540

Yuanyuan, don't worry.

by the embroidered ball.

Your Highness, I'm sorry.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.540
I failed to keep the embroidered ball.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.340
But I really couldn't defeat them.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.140
This guy can fight. He can fight.

I... I could have defeated them,

but that would

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.420
make the embroidered ball mine.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.540
I'm just a boor.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.940
I dare not offend you.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.580
You stood by on purpose.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.540
You're asking for a beating.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.180
Zi Nian.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.460
Your Highness.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.460
You must not agree

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.100
to marry Mr. Lu.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.260
I know the Crown Princess is unreliable

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.820
because she promised to help you,

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.140
but sneaked out to watch
the fireworks with Young Master Han.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.940
But you shouldn't give yourself up.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.580
No.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.980
Yuanyuan, I'm sorry.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.180
I know I made a mistake.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.300
But you and Lu Peng aren't a good match.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.300
Promise me

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.060
that you won't agree to marry him.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.260
If Lu Peng can be subservient
to me all the time

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.500
and ingratiate himself with me,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.620
it'll be nice.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.140
But... But... I...

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.180
Your Highness, Mr. Lu is here.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.580
Did I summon him?

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.100
Mr. Lu said

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.340
he would be your husband.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.820
So I couldn't stop him.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.060
What brought you here?

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.340
I know

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.500
you love Maixiangcun's pastries.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.660
So I stood in a line waiting
for the whole night

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.820
to buy your favorite chestnut cake.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.660
Mr. Lu,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.140
you didn't sleep last night.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.420
Look, the dark circles
under your eyes are so obvious.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.580
Go back and have some rest.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.700
What's the matter?

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.620
Mr. Lu has taken his luggage along.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.100
I'm your husband-to-be, after all.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.500
I can't continue to stay in
the Music and Dance Academy.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.500
But I also can't move
into your mansion today.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.780
Then where will you live?

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.260
It's your call.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.460
So you're saying

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.500
Yuanyuan

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.260
should buy a property for you?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.580
You think too much, Your Highness.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.500
After we get married,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.900
all my things will belong
to the Princess Royal.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.940
Even I will

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.740
belong to the Princess Royal.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.020
Zi Nian.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.820
Do as he says.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.900
Mr. Lu, let's go.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.580
Yuanyuan.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.140
Mr. Su is here.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.860
He's waiting for the
Princess Royal in the yard.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.180
He sent this.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.420
Give me. Give me. Give me.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.100
Look. Look.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.940
Yuanyuan, I said the
embroidered ball would help.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.340
He must have felt regret.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.300
Look. He has sent you a token of love.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.860
I said the embroidered ball would help.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.740
Your Highness,

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.020
this is the token of love

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.900
the Princess Royal has given Mr. Su.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.460
You are noble like the moon

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.340
while I'm lowly like a grain of dust.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.180
I don't deserve this jade pendant.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.900
Your Highness,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.100
Lu Peng is ill-natured.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.660
If you marry him anyway,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.940
you'll feel regret someday.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.780
I hope...

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.020
If you marry me,

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.140
I won't marry him.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.380
I'm a worse choice for you.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.420
Do you

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.420
wish to spend

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.220
the rest of your life

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.940
with a promiscuous and dissolute musician?

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.820
In some cases,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.500
you should look beyond the present.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.780
Where should I look if not the present?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.900
You all make decisions for me

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.100
and claim the decisions are made

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.420
for my own good.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.500
But in the end,

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.060
you don't know what I want.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.100
Or maybe

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.060
you don't care about me at all.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.260
You think too much, Your Highness.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.060
After they get married,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.660
all Lu Peng's things will
belong to the Princess Royal.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.500
Even Lu Peng will belong
to the Princess Royal.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.940
Lu Peng is obviously
determined to marry Yuanyuan,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.180
so he can climb the social ladder.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.260
Have some tea.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.420
Thank you.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.500
On my way back home,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.300
I bought Maixiangcun's pastries.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.180
What a gigolo!

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.420
What is a gigolo?

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.260
He eats a woman's food.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.340
He uses a woman's things.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.300
He even covets a woman's family assets.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.300
A few chestnut cakes won't justify
the fact that he lives off a woman.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:13.980
Young Master,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.460
how come the Crown Princess started
to reprimand you right after she came back?

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.820
How did she know

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.620
we had coveted her family assets at first?

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:23.980
I

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.060
despise this kind of man the most.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.740
Can't he fend for himself?

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.500
Can't he earn his own living?

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.420
He chose to build his wealth
by taking advantage of a woman.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.300
He's basically selling his body.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.740
That sounds so disparaging.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.180
Maybe he was

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.820
forced to depend on a woman.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.420
But he chose the path.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.300
He must be harboring ulterior motives.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.300
What if he is actually assertive

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.740
and feigning a weak attitude?

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.820
He shouldn't have cheated to get married.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.380
But he was forced to marry at first.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.100
If it wasn't his will, he shouldn't have
tried to catch the embroidered ball.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.100
He didn't look

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.860
unwilling to me.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.700
You're talking about Lu Peng?

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.500
Who are you talking about?

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.540
-Him. -Him.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.140
Yeah. How did I forget?

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.380
I'm not single anymore.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.380
I've told the City Owner
about my resignation.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.180
I'll cease to work as
the Minister of Education.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.860
From now on, I won't come
to the clan school anymore.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:02.860
Are you leaving because of me?

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.980
But you can't resign as
the Minister of Education.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.660
I thought you always pursued independence.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.820
You took great pains to become

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.260
the only male official in Huayuan City.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.020
Even though I've climbed

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.420
to the highest position
among all men in Huayuan City,

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.300
I can't have you.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.820
My only regret is

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.780
that I didn't

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.260
realize I love you sooner.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.620
You and I grew up together.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.460
We had been engaged for over ten years.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.980
I've known you for a longer time
than Young Master Han.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.740
Every time you saw me,

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.140
your eyes lit up.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.780
You gave me Qin.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:42.820
How come

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.580
I still lost you?

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.420
I don't understand.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:55.460
I'm unwilling to give in.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.700
(Hold world with virtue)

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.180
Han Shuo, don't get any wild ideas.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.180
I... I didn't...

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.820
How come your eyes never light up for me?

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.420
What to do now?

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.580
Even I have been convinced by him.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:17.900
Hell,

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.060
if a woman gave me Qin

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.900
and encouraged me to become
the most honorable man in Huayuan City,

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.020
not to mention she'd been
engaged to me for over ten years,

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.060
I'd remain faithful to her

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.540
and never abandon her.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.940
I'd play music for her.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:34.820
How about

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.660
you play with me?

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.820
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.140
Minister Pei.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.140
I'm no longer a minister.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.540
Mr. Pei.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.020
I appreciate you taking me in.
I can't thank you enough.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.020
Now you've stopped
working in the clan school,

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.740
I won't continue to serve you,

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.100
spreading papers and making ink.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.380
Are you leaving?

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.820
You can stay in my mansion.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.220
I know I'm of humble birth.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.500
I will stop

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.420
dreaming of certain things.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.340
Are you talking about the Princess Royal?

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.940
You and I have the same trouble.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:45.820
(Su Mu)

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.820
(Ming Lan)

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.260
(Su Mu)

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.340
The shingle has been hung.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.100
(Music and Dance Academy)

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.340
Where are you going?

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.420
Don't you know?

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.780
Su Mu is back to the Music and Dance Academy.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.340
He's hanging out his shingle today.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.300
-Su Mu is back to the Music and Dance Academy.
-Let's go.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:18.780
Hurry up.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.740
Su Mu is back to the Music and Dance Academy.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.180
(Music and Dance Academy)

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:45.700
Boring.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.740
He just left for a while.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.820
But his temper has become filthier.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.860
Does he think he's clean?

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.540
He even picks and chooses his customers.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.420
My lady.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.100
Stop beating or scolding him.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.380
We still need him to make money.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.660
Haven't you noticed

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.100
that fewer people are coming
to the Music and Dance Academy?

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.660
At least Su Mu is better than Lu Peng.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.580
Lu Peng

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.140
goes to the City Owner's mansion every day.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.580
He should look at himself.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.780
Young Master, the City Owner
didn't summon us.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.620
Why are we here?

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.260
We shouldn't wait for
the City Owner to summon us.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.780
A man should take the initiative

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.340
to get close to the City Owner.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.300
I'll be her son-in-law in the future.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.500
Wait here.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.340
But...

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.980
Your wedding date isn't set yet.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.260
From what I have seen,

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.940
the Princess Royal tends to ignore you.

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.100
I heard that Han Shuo got accepted

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.540
by the Crown Princess
because he wore a bracelet.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.820
Now I've found this bracelet from
a craftsman and initiated to wear it,

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.100
the City Owner will surely adore
a sensible son-in-law like me.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.340
Parents get to decide
their children's marriages.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.660
The Princess Royal can't say no.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.220
You're saying you want to
take troops to search Yueli Mansion?

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.220
The envoys of Xuanhu City haven't gone far.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.700
There must be proof in the mansion.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.820
If we launch a surprise attack now,

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.220
Han Shuo will give himself away for sure.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.500
Mother, on the night of
the Double Seventh Festival,

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.180
Han Shuo changed his plan at the last minute.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.500
He really had prepared explosives.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.740
He must have noticed something,

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.980
so he changed...

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.740
How dare you mention it?

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.060
I thought you'd be sensible

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.980
and leave it behind.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.340
I didn't expect you

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.420
to keep pestering me

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.620
with this matter.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.020
Then

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.540
you've already known

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.500
what Han Shuo has done.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:29.980
You...

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.420
You know, but you let it pass.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.700
Are you protecting Han Shuo

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.180
or Chen Qianqian?

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.340
How dare you talk back?

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.460
You're simply afraid that
Chen Qianqian will get in trouble

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.700
and lose her Crown Princess' position.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.580
You have spared Han Shuo,

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.660
allowing him to bring disaster to Huayuan.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.020
Bring disaster to Huayuan?

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.100
Han Shuo has given up his plan

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.540
for Qianqian.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.580
And look at you.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.940
For the Crown Princess' position,

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.420
you would gamble

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.540
on your younger sister Qianqian,

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.100
me and the whole Huayuan City.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.980
Has it occurred to you

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.100
that if Han Shuo's plan had worked out,

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.020
the land under your feet

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.980
would have sunk into misery and ruin?

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.220
I want to arrest Han Shuo

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.220
to protect you and the whole Huayuan City.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.580
That's just your excuse!

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.460
Mother.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.620
For Qianqian,

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.140
you'd rather nurture the dangerous seed.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.820
I only seek your approval.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.820
I want to feel that
I've done something right,

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.660
even if it's the only thing

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.260
I've done right.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.020
Since I was little

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.780
you have never favored me.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.060
I just want to know why
I'm different from Qianqian.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.780
It's like she is your biological child

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.140
and I'm not.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.620
Of course you two are different.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.180
Since you were little,

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.900
I've been raising you as my successor.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.940
Your successor?

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.300
Your successor is Chen Qianqian.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.660
She is the Crown Princess.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.060
You have never

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.660
favored me once.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.580
You...

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.100
Chuchu.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.580
Chuchu.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.260
Your Majesty.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.140
Your Majesty, are you okay?

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:09.780
I pay respect to you, Your Highness.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.700
What are you doing here?

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.860
I came to discuss

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.300
my wedding with the Princess Royal.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:13.980
I've just arrived

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.340
and run into you.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.780
Forgive me, Your Highness.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.220
What did you hear?

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.620
Having just arrived, I heard nothing.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.580
Yuanyuan, how is she doing?
What's the situation?

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.780
She has a stroke.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.180
Her pulse tells me

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.060
that she's been in bad health for a while.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.780
Her fit of anger

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.620
is simply a factor.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.620
Yeah.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.140
The City Owner showed the signs
of a stroke before this.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.300
But fearing it'd unleash panic in the city,

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.220
she had been covering her illness.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.660
How come it attacked now?

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.460
Well...

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.580
Chen Chuchu.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.420
What is it? Say it now.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.620
Mother is not what you imagine her to be.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.420
I only believe what I see.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.660
Mother has defended you
since you were little.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.220
Han Shuo came to our city

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.140
to marry me.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.260
But you stole him.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.380
Now you've even got
the Crown Princess' position.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.580
You all claim our mother treats me well.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.140
What do you mean by well?

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.580
I can give you the Crown Princess' position.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.940
You've said it more than once.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.140
When did it become reality?

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:53.500
Not long ago,

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.620
you said you'd let me have Han Shuo.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:58.540
I bought it.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.260
But what happened then?

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.180
I saw you and Han Shuo

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.180
being so affectionate.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.620
Mother shows favoritism.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.900
She's given you everything.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.180
Mother has fallen ill.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.340
You shouldn't resent her.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.980
I dare not resent her.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.260
Chuchu.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.020
Many things happened by chance,

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.460
unlike what you thought.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:22.540
You can stay mad at me

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.660
and continue to resent me.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.580
But please don't regard our mother that way.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.340
If you insist on doing so,

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.260
then I'll think you have changed,

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.980
and I won't let you have

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.100
Han Shuo or power.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.740
Get out.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.780
Where is the City Owner?

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.660
We haven't seen
the City Owner for a long time.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.420
When will we get to see the City Owner?

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.380
Yeah.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.020
Go home, please.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.580
The City Owner is still resting.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.620
What shall we do now?

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.860
The government documents are heaping up.

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.300
You are right.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.780
After the envoys of
Xuanhu City left our city,

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:04.620
they've lingered 250 kilometers away

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.860
from our city for some reason.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.300
Xuanhu's intent is all too clear.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.460
In such troubled times,

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.860
there will be unimaginable consequences

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.180
if others know the City Owner is bedridden.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:21.940
Your Highness.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.100
As the Crown Princess,

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.300
I declare martial law citywide.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.540
Stop the news from spreading.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:31.820
But...

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.140
Martial law?

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:33.900
What?

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.220
Am I not the Crown Princess?

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.180
Your Highness.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.380
In such troubled times,

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.140
the envoys of Xuanhu City are eyeing us.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.940
If anyone reveals my mother's illness,

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.340
I'll wipe out her family.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:54.980
Yes.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.900
It's the Crown Princess' order.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.380
(Crown Princess' Order)

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.700
For defying the City Owner,

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:26.260
the Second Princess shall be
grounded in Xingzi Mansion

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.820
and copy the Classic of Filial Piety
for 100 times as punishment.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:31.820
Your Highness.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.660
The Crown Princess has made it clear

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.180
that you must not copy
the classic one time less.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.300
Sangqi, even you're helping Chen Qianqian.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.860
Your Highness.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.100
Why don't you ask

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.060
about the City Owner's
current health condition?

00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.460
Mother has always been healthy.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.580
In the past, Chen Qianqian irritated
her into falling ill repeatedly.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.140
How come I'm rebellious and disobedient

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.460
when I do it

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.260
and she's naive and innocent

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.060
when she does it?

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.180
You simply show favoritism.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.420
(Irises and orchids lasting
for thousands of years)

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:23.820
Zi Zhu.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.140
Your Highness.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.940
Chen Qianqian has taken control
of the government affairs.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.060
You are trapped in the mansion
and can't exert your power.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.500
We need to find a way out.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.500
Power and man,

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.900
I want both of them.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.780
Your Highness, I think

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.820
we should shut some peoples' mouth first.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.660
We can't give others grounds for accusations.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.780
We can't let the public know

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.420
the City Owner has fallen ill
because you irritated her.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.420
I pay respect to you, Your Highness.
