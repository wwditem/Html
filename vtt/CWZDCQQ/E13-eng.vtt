Han... Han Shuo!

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.860
Listen to me! This is the moment

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.740
to test

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.940
the hero's character.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.460
You've got to withstand the test!

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.140
Han Shuo!

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.140

Han Shuo! Wake up!

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.500
Han Shuo!

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.140
The smell of the aphrodisiac incense
will kill you if you hold your desire.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.500
You are my rightful wife,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.100
but we haven't slept together.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.980
It makes sense though.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.940
We didn't do the wedding parade,

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.180
didn't offer sacrifice to Heaven,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.220
didn't even hold a formal ceremony.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.780
If I can get back to Huayuan alive,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.740
I promise I'll make it up to you!

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.660
It's bad karma,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.900
since I took you away to marry me that day.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.500
I don't want you to die.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.620
I swear to God

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.140
that I won't ever betray you,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.780
or I'll die a violent death...

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.820
Young Master, I'm here to save you!

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.780
There you go!

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.860
Fortunately, I got here in time!

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.220
Young Master,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.460
Zi Rui came to me in a hurry

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.780
and told me that Her Highness was in danger.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.500
Su Ziying also came to me for help.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.420
Luckily, I found a basin of cold water
in the nick of time

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.500
and broke in with all my strength.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.900
Otherwise...

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.460
Otherwise...

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.020
Otherwise, what?

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.980
I... I just realized I did something wrong!

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.860
Young Master,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.380
please give me another chance
to fix my mistakes!

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.980
Do you know how many times you've said it

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.420
since we came to Huayuan City?

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.660
Bai Ji,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.220
do you want to return to Xuanhu City?

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.340
No, I don't.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.060
We almost consummated our relationship.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.700
But why do I feel a little sorry
that we didn't?

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.060
I even want to kill Bai Ji
for interrupting us.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.660
When we were in the storage room,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.540
why didn't I push him away?

if your vulnerable heart could take it.

Don't worry.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.860

What's that sound?

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.620
I once blamed Heaven

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.300
for having me suffer from heart disease.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.900
Yet you stole the Dragon Bone and cured me.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.260
If you were born in Xuanhu City,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.020
I'd absolutely send an
eight-carrier sedan to marry you,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.700
abide by the principle
of the "Three Letters and Six Etiquettes".

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:27.780
I'd use swan goose to deliver the letters,

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.500
and spend

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.420
the rest of my life

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.900

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.700
No one will ever get in the way of us.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.980
But in Huayuan City,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.980
women aren't serious about love, I guess.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.620
Do you understand

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.660
my heart now?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.580
Can't believe Han Shuo loves me?!

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.500
No wonder he said

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.140
that he didn't want me
to put him together with Chuchu.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.100
Turns out he's in love with me!

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.180
But he can't be in love with me!

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.900
So strange!

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.340
Why it feels like there are butterflies

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.420
in my stomach?

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:19.980
Your Highness!

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.820
What happened exactly?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.540
The Crown Princess and Young Master Han

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.820
were locked in a storage room

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.420
and exposed to aphrodisiac incense.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.900
Aphrodisiac incense?

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.820
That was an accident!

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.020
I happened to go to the storage room
to find something,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.780
and bumped into Young Master Han,

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.380
who was exposed to aphrodisiac incense.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.540
I thought this thing was very weird.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.180
The pageboy of the inn must
have had something to do with it.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.900
So I wanted to ask him,

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.900
but I couldn't find him anywhere.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.580
I guess

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.540
he must have fled

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.140
for fear of punishment.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.660
Do you have evidence

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.900
to prove that he did it?

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.460
It's just my suspicion.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.820
If he were innocent,

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.060
why would he escape?

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.860
He must have been involved.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.260
But in this case,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
we'll have no way to find out
who's the mastermind.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.860
I'm useless!

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.140
I couldn't catch that pageboy

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.300
to find out who was behind it.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.740
I failed to serve Your Highness
and Young Master well!

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.580
I have let my master down!

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:22.940
Obviously, it was...

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.380
Obviously, it was done
by that pageboy himself.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.580
There's nothing more to investigate.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.140
It was all that pageboy's fault, wasn't it?

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.020
Yes, it was.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.260
Your Highness,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.620
Su Ziying was clearly lying,

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.540
why didn't you call him out?

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.260
I have my reason to keep him.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.540
That pageboy was able to escape secretly

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.260
after helping Su Ziying.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.300
What does that tell you?

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.100
It shows that Su Ziying is very cautious

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.540
and sly.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.660
Young Master,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.580
why didn't you just kill that Su Ziying,

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.300
in case he'll harm Her Highness again?

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.100
I certainly have my reason to keep him.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.860
He's good at lying.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.100
It's easy to kill him,

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.860
but if the lies remain,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.700
Pei Heng may use them as excuses

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.740
to slander me in front of Qianqian.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.740
Then let him bring it on!

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.820
Why did Su Ziying

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.820
do all those things?

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.820
His purpose was to get me
out of the way of Chuchu.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.340
Fine!

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.260
I'll make him satisfied!

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.380
Why does Su Ziying try to harm Qianqian?

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.580
Of course it's for
the Crown Princess position.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.140
As long as I'm here,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.380
I won't let anybody

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.900
take her down from that position.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.620
I just feel sorry for Pei Heng.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.460
He's still kept in the dark

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.260
and thinks

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.700
that Su Ziying

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.260
is a loyal person.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.380
By then, we'll

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.980
reveal his acts of harming Qianqian,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.260
and bring him to Pei Heng.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.540
Let's see how Pei Heng will deal with it.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.580
I will keep an eye on him.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.700
I won't miss any detail.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.780
Very good!

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.580
So, let's keep everything normal.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.740
We'll play along
and watch him at the same time.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.620
Don't let Su Ziying feel anything different.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.940
In that case,

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.140
Your Highness, don't be angry

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.740
for Su Ziying anymore.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:26.740
It's not worth it.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.180
I'm not angry. I'm not.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.300
No matter how annoying the role is,

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.620
it was created by myself.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.940
I saw it coming. I'm not embarrassed.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.420
Then why are you patting your chest?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.260
I'm patting my chest

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.620
to calm the butterflies

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.060
in me.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.780
Your Highness,

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.740
the Second Princess asks you
to play chess with her.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.340
Play chess?

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.500
Why did you want to play chess
with me all of a sudden?

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.900
I remember when we were little,

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.140
we played gomoku all the time.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.500
You could never win

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.940
even when I let you take
the first eight moves.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.140
Right.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.980
You always thought of me first.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.580
You still do nowadays.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.220
I've always given you whatever you wanted

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.420
since we were little.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.820
Over time,

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.620
you've kinda got used to it.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.380
If...

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.540
If I give you back

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.460
the thing that originally belonged to you,

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.300
will you accept it?

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.620
The thing that originally belonged to me?

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.580
You are quite concerned about our city.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.100
You are more qualified

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.780
to be the Crown Princess than me.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.460
But that's not

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.940
the only thing I want.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.780
You mean...

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.380
You and Young Master Han were
locked in the storage room today,

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.900
and both of you were exposed
to aphrodisiac incense.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.140
Speaking of that, I'm so mad!

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.060
It's all that pageboy's fault that...

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.180
You are Han Shuo's wife.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.540
If he wanted to harm you,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.340
why would he do something like that?

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.860
I think the one he meant to lock in there

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.180
wasn't you.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.460
Chuchu...

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.020
As far as I'm concerned,

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.300
it was the same trick as the one you used

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.220
when you lured me into a trap

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.660
and asked Han Shuo to save me.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.220
Feels like the tricks

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.860
were done by the same person.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.020
Was it because last time it didn't work,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.100
so you asked someone

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.140
to poison me and Han Shuo
with aphrodisiac incense.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.140
But that pageboy made a mistake

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.260
in the process

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.420
and locked you in there

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.060
instead of me.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.260
Not really.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.820
Chuchu, it's a misunderstanding.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.940
Please don't misunderstand me.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:38.980
Please don't blame me.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.540
I don't blame you.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.060
Instead, I need to thank you.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.900
Thank me?

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.340
This time,

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.620
I won't back down anymore.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.220
If you don't want Han Shuo, I will.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.300
You want him? Well...

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.140
I'm fond of Han Shuo.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.860
You fell for him that fast?

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.860
What? Feel sad about losing him?

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.540
No.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.660
I'm just...

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.900
Actually, that makes it a lot easier.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.180
It's a good thing!

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.580
You are supposed to fall in love with him.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.740
So you were saying

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.380
you'll let me have him?

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.940
Don't worry, Chuchu. I'll take care of it.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.580
After getting back to Huayuan City,

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.300
I'll figure out a way to divorce Han Shuo

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.980
and give him back to you.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.300
Han Shuo

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.420
is still that Han Shuo.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.900
I didn't touch him at all.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.140
He's intact.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:23.980
I won!

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.140
Your Highness.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.940
Why are you covering your chest again?

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.900
Where are my butterflies?

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.420
I don't feel fluttery anymore.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.620
But you seem to be unhappy.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.460
How can I be happy about losing chess game?

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.620
I only lost a chess game,

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.620
but how come

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.340
it feels like I've lost the whole world?

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.740
We'll set out soon! Be careful

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.380
and follow my lead!

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.020
Yes!

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.820
Young Master Han, I don't mean to offend you,

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.780
but Her Highness doesn't allow me to get off.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.420
Neither does she allow me to get off.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.300
Han Shuo, stop it!

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.980
Han Shuo!

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.900
Han Shuo! What are you doing?

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.060
Put me down!

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:04.980
From now on,

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.940
I won't allow you to ride
the carriage with other men!

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.940
Han Shuo! Put me down!

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:13.940
Or I'll jump off myself!

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:14.860
I'm serious!

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.620
Han Shuo,

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.700
I do not like you.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:28.980
What did you say?

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.300
I said "I don't like you!"

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.460
Didn't you hear me?

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.620
I don't believe it.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:38.940
You obviously have me in your heart.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:39.980
Why don't you admit it?

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.620
Would you please stop being a narcissist?

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.620
I am Chen Qianqian, for God's sake!

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.660
I've seen so many men in my life.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.620
I don't feel excited about you anymore.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.460
Don't think I can't live without you!

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.900
You were lying!

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.620
See?

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.900
You didn't even push me away!

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.740
You were just bluffing!

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.140
Anyway, I can't be with you.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.940
Otherwise, it'll make a lot of trouble.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.620
I don't care.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.980
As long as I'm in your heart,

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.860
there'll be no room for other guys.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.460
Whatever you think. Anyway,

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.900
we are just like Huayuan City
and Xuanhu City.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.260
We are from two completely different worlds.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.620
I can't give up my world

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:44.980
just for you.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.740
And I can't

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.980
stay here all the time.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.260
So will you be with me

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.580
if the problem between Huayuan

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.180
and Xuanhu is solved?

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.300
You'll never understand.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.420
(City Owner's Mansion)

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.660
Report!

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.780
Great victory achieved on Weimeng Mountain!

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.500
Your Majesty,

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.500
the bandits on Weimeng Mountain

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.940
have submitted to Her Highness' enlistment!

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.420
The bandits have been
successfully suppressed!

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.180
Good!

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.180
I knew that she could make it!

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.820
All the best to Her Highness!

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.740
All the best to Your Majesty!

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.500
All the best to Huayuan City!

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.420
Your Majesty, now you can be relieved!

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.300
Su,

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.780
I'm new here,

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.780
hope I can have your support in the future.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.580
Meng, I'm flattered.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.260
I'm just a servant.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.300
Be careful!

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.380
Gently move the cases.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.180
Okay?

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:16.980
It's such a huge yard!

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.540
Meng Guo.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.820
Let's give them a hand.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.620
Alright.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:27.980
What are you doing?

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.580
Don't act confused.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.700
The Crown Princess just gave an order.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.620
From now on...

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.620
...as the study is an important place...

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.460
...in which is stored with a lot
of confidential documents...

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.340
...so the irrelevant people...

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.460
...won't be allowed in!

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.620
Meng,

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.340
here is   different from Weimeng Mountain.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.340
We have to follow the rules.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.180
Meng.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.700
If you need any help, just ask me.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.380
Let me take you to your room.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.300
Thank you, Su!

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:12.980
Master, greetings to you!

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.340
Has Qianqian got back to her mansion?

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.780
How is she doing?

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.140
Did you take good care of her

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.380
on the Weimeng Mountain trip?

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.740
What... What are you doing?

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.420
Master, I kept your words in mind

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.300
and did my best to take care
of the Third Princess.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.420
But Han Shuo

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.540
sowed discord between Her Highness and me.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.180
And now, Her Highness suspects
that I'm up to something

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.060
and doesn't trust me anymore!

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.460
That's just the way Han Shuo is!

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.020
Please rise.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.220
But Han Shuo

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.380
not only intercepted my letter to you,

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.020
but also repeated put Her Highness

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.780
in danger during the trip.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.180
What? Stand up and talk!

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.900
Han Shuo played up to
the Second Princess all the time,

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.900
while he left the Third Princess
in the inn alone.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.900
As a result, she was taken
by the bandit Meng Guo.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.420
When his scheme of harming
Her Highness was exposed,

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.380
Han Shuo

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.180
used the aphrodisiac incense

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.980
to try to take advantage of Her Highness!

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.860
Really?

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.740
After Han Shuo's evil plan failed,

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.540
Her Highness got confused
about Han Shuo's intention,

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.060
so she kept putting up with him,

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.580
If Her Highness asks you to get me back,

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.180
then...

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:17.940
Don't worry.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.020
I'll persuade her

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.820
to let you stay in her mansion.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.340
Qianqian is young and ignorant.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.140
You need to help her as much as you can.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.580
Yes!

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.780
In fall she howls to let leaves fall;

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.820
In spring she hums to rouse flowers.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.740
Across the sea she whirls waves miles tall;

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.340
Through bamboos
she bends them with her power.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.580
Let me repeat.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.980
In fall she howls to let leaves fall...

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.340
How should I turn Han Shuo down

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.860
to let him give up?

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.380
I can't resist his gaze!

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.700
Through bamboos
she bends them with her power.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.140
Next,

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.260
let's read "Mountain Life On
An Autumn Evening" by Wang Wei.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.740
After fresh rain in the empty mountains;

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.420
the evening weather heralds autumn's arrival.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.980
The bright moon shines between the pines;

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.740
the clear spring water flows over the stones.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.140
Minister Pei,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.380
would you please stand here to teach today,

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.180
so that I can hear you more clearly?

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.140
Sure.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.620
It's the best I can do
under the circumstances.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.820
Sorry, Pei Heng.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.460
By the way, Minister Pei.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.460
I learned two lines from a poem
a couple of days ago.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.180
Would you please hear me recite them?

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.380
Of course.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.660
In my life I know not what lovesickness is;

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.620
my body is like floating clouds
and my heart is as still as duckweed.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.660
When I was on Weimeng Mountain,

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.300
I missed you very much.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.700
Chen Qianqian, what are you talking about?

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.940
You've had Han Shuo,

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.100
yet you still try to seduce Minister Pei!

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.900
The grass is always greener
on the other side, huh?

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.140
As least I'm not as starving as you are!

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.740
Will you mind your own business?

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.140
Minister Pei is not interested in you at all!

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.780
I know he isn't,

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.260
so I have to be forward!

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.580
When the pain of lovesickness comes;

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.580
the lamp is half-dusk
while the moon is half-bright.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.100
Qianqian, are these
the rest two lines of your poem?

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.620
Yes. Why did you complete it?

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.540
Don't you remember?

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.020
We recited it together when we were little.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.860
Qianqian is ill-informed.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.700
She doesn't know that this poem
isn't about the friendship

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.180
between teacher and student,
but expressing love.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.620
Sorry if she offended you.
Please forgive her.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.060
If she doesn't know, I can teach her.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:45.700
But,

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.860
I do think she knows what it means.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.820
She does not know!

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.740
She does!

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.620
-Do you know? -Do you know?

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.140
Time's up! Class dismissed!

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:07.940
Qianqian!

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.100
Your Highness, what about your book?

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.140
My life is more important!

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.660
Tear down the east wall
to repair the west wall,

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.420
which is not a permanent fix.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.820
I have to discuss it with the advisers.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.060
In case I'll do something wrong

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.180
to screw things up!

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.220
Yes!

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.020
Weimeng Mountain is located at the junction

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.340
of Xuanhu City and Huayuan City.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.860
With its rough terrain,

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.020
it's been home to all kinds of bandits,

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.580
who were highly skilled in Kung Fu

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.460
and extremely fierce.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.340
The traveling merchants often got robbed

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.540
and suffered from their bullying.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.300
The bandit head, Meng Guo,

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.100
was as strong as a black bear,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.380
had muscles all over his body,

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.620
and his skin was tough as an iron ox's.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.820
He was invulnerable
and he killed for pleasure.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.220
People were all terrified of him
as if he were devil!

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.540
However, Her Highness

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.740
was so resourceful and brave;

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.540
she had no fear of him at all!

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.220
She adopted "empty-city strategy",

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.340
pretending that she didn't have enough force

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.500
and luring the bandits into the city.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.740
Meng Guo was just a boor,

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.100
who knew nothing about art of war.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.420
As expected, he fell into the trap

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.860
and was captured by Young Master Han
and the Second Princess.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.540
Great!

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.660
Take a guess.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.860
What did Her Highness do to Meng Guo

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.460
after she caught him?

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.820
Killed him! Killed him! Killed him!

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.740
She released him!

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.060
That's right! He was released!

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.620
In order to make Meng Guo
willingly accept his defeat,

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.300
Her Highness caught him seven times
and released him seven times.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.620
As for the details,

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.260
please stay tuned.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.500
After the "empty-city strategy",

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.940
Her Highness won a tough battle
at Baiyin Valley, burned rattan-armor army,

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.900
outsmarted Meng Guo,
debated with a bunch of scholars,

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.860
wisely borrowed Weimeng Mountain

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.820
and broke into the enemy's camp alone.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.980
Amazing! So amazing!

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:04.820
In this way,

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.460
Her Highness defeated bandit Meng Guo

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.140
with very little effort

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.940
and enlisted him in the end.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.940
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.220
Isn't this Her Highness?

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.580
Your Highness!

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.540
You were amazing defeating the bandits!

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.860
You were so amazing!

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.460
Of course, she only put in little effort.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.740
The bandits were caught
by you and Young Master Han!

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:25.860
She was only in charge of releasing them.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.140
Why should she take all the credit?

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.140
Because she's the Crown Princess.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.460
Your Highness, you are smart and brave!

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:38.660
Chuchu!

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.460
Chuchu!

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.460
Bad news! Your Highness!

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.780
What's up? Who did you frame again?

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.260
Not me! It's Young Master Han.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.420
He's going to challenge Minister Pei!

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.700
Is it because of the...

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.380
the poem I recited in class?

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.140
Yes!

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.740
Young Master Han thinks
that Minister Pei likes you.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.660
He learned that your engagement is still on,

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.580
so he asked Minster Pei
to the theater to have a duel!

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.780
My master is just a weak scholar.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.940
I'm afraid that...

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.140
It's my bad! It's my bad!

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.020
Pei Heng used to hate me so much.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.660
He only sees me as a friend now.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.020
I can't put him in trouble!

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.300
What should I do?

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.540
You asked me to be here,

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.620
yet you don't say anything.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.380
The clan school is a place for study,

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.700
where it's not proper
to talk about affection.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.940
Minister Pei,

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.300
why did you complete

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.780
Qianqian's poem just now?

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.420
Qianqian already has a husband.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.420
I don't think

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.380
your behavior was appropriate.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.660
You are Qianqian's husband;

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.580
you should've been the one she's closest to.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.620
But you didn't cherish her well.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.940
From now on,

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.100
I won't hide my feelings
for Qianqian anymore.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.540
I'll let her know who's good and who's bad,

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.660
so that she can leave you.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:09.900
Pei Heng,

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.460
why don't you understand?

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.380
You and Qianqian won't work.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.660
Maybe not right now

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.900
when she's blinded by you.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.580
But in the future,

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.620
I will let Qianqian change her mind.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.220
Don't call her Qianqian
as if you were close to her.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.100
Qianqian!

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.300
You...

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.660
Son of a bitch!

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.100
How dare you offend my wife?

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.180
You are shameless!

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.500
Minister Pei,

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.660
I didn't mean that.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.620
But as long as I'm alive,

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.860
you and Qianqian will never be together.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:52.540
I...

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.980
I can wait!

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.580
People will get old.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.060
You will sooner or later lose your strength.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.540
I didn't mean that either.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.100
Do you think your nonsense can fool me?

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.100
Sounds like you've become smarter!

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.740
I was fooling you!

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.220
You... You son of a bitch!

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:11.940
You are!

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:12.780
You are!

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.540
No! You are!

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:14.420
You are!

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.380
You are!

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.220
You are!

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.460
Stop the play on the stage.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.140
Right now!

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:20.780
Never mind!

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.140
I've

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.500
made myself very clear.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.300
I believe that you've heard me.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.260
I have one more question for you.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.300
Do you know what kinda person

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.420
Su Ziying really is?

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.020
He is a threat to Qianqian
and has been trying to harm her.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.660
Are you aware of that?

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.220
Su Ziying is my hand-picked servant.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.460
If I knew nothing about him,

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.820
how could I send him to Qianqian

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.220
to serve her?

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.300
So, Young Master,

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.340
between you and Su Ziying,

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.140
who do you think I'll trust?

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.100
Seems like Pei Heng is really the one

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.060
who asked Su Ziying to do all those things.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.820
Why don't you say I'm wise?

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.180
Young Master,

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.860
there's no way that it's Minister Pei.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.220
Minister Pei likes Her Highness.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.300
He wouldn't ask Su Ziying
to harm her repeatedly.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.420
He might do that to you though.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.220
No...

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.940
You are quite smart
when you are not expected to be.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:39.900
But it's not bad actually.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.220
I'll find a chance

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.460
to get the goods on Su Ziying.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.500
And I'll let Pei Heng know

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.300
what kinda person

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.380
he sent to Qianqian.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.020
Let's see how ashamed he'll be then!

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.580
Who arranged today's play?

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.900
It's such a coincidence!

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.420
It's... It's such an accident!

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.260
Hurry, Zi Rui!

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:03.980
So slow!

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.060
I'm here!

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.100
Where's Pei Heng?

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.140
He left.

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.100
Left?

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.380
What did you say to him?

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.700
Nothing.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.580
(Zhezi opera: The unfaithful woman
dumps her husband)

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.740
(Zhezi opera: Beat the paramour)

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.020
Han Shuo,

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.860
I really overestimated you.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.020
For such a trivial thing,

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.340
you called Pei Heng here to set him up?

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.180
I just invited him over to have some tea.

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.220
Have some tea?

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.740
You asked him to be here
to watch these plays.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.140
Obviously, you were trying to insult

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.460
and threaten him.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.580
It was just a love poem,

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:40.860
and I was the one who started it.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.860
If you want to blame,

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.220
you should blame me first.

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.260
Would you stop making a scene?

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.100
You are a jealous man!

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.020
Jealous man?

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.140
Exactly! You are!

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.340
You are indeed a jealous man!

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.300
You are so petty!

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.380
Can't you open your mind just a little bit?

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:55.820
I'm a jealous man?

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.260
You are my wife!

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:57.940
You read a love poem

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.020
with another man in front of me.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.340
I can't even ask about it?

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.180
Why do you always side with Pei Heng

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.500
whenever I argue with him?

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.540
Don't you care about my feelings at all?

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.700
Our marriage is over!

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.100
Just get out of here!

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.100
Spare the room for me!

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.380
Is that what you think?

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.860
I...

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.140
What a crappy play is that?

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.580
I don't have time to explain!

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.340
I'm leaving!

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.140
Zi Rui!

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.580
Where can I go to complain?

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:39.060
I feel sad, resentful, embarrassed and angry!

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.620
I'm filled with fury!

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.620
You asked me to be open-minded?

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.980
Okay, fine!

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.580
Bai Ji.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.340
Yes.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.020
Deliver my invitation

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.260
to Minister Pei's mansion.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.180
I'll invite him to my place to have a talk!

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.340
Why is Su Ziying here?

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.940
It must be Su Ziying
who told Her Highness about this meeting.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.500
I saw him sneaking around

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.060
downstairs earlier,

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.460
having a smug look on his face!

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.780
What's this about?

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.420
I want to apologize
for what I did to Minister Pei.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.580
Apologize?

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.820
I know I was wrong.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.020
I was being jealous.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.980
In fact, you didn't do anything wrong.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.220
You just shouldn't have
got angry with Pei Heng.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.500
After all, I dragged...

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.340
Forget it.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.180
Let's drink.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.860
It's water under the bridge.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.460
That's right!

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.380
Master! Young Master Han!

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.140
Mr. Meng, what are you doing here?

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.860
Young Master invited me

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.140
to have a drink tonight.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.060
Meng Guo just arrived in Huayuan City.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.060
He's alone

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.020
and has no company.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.140
So I invited him to join us for the meal.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:19.580
Sure!

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:23.820
Yingying,

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.340
what brought you here?

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.540
Young Master Han invited me

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.380
to have a drink tonight.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.220
But how could I eat together
with Your Highness

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.300
and Young Master Han?

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.860
I really don't dare.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.380
I knew Han Shuo wouldn't be this generous!

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.180
Since you are here,

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.540
have some dinner with us.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.180
Besides, you can help us refill
wine glasses and add dishes.

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:45.020
Thank you for your hard work.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.420
In that case,

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.500
I'll listen to Your Highness.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.620
It's just a meal.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.420
Is it necessary to get
the bodyguard and butler here?

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.380
Minister Pei

00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.660
is on his way, too.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.420
You also invited Pei Heng?

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.460
Han Shuo, what are you trying to do?

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.260
I've kept all the words

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.340
you told me in mind.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.300
I thought we've made a deal
that it was all water under the bridge.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.740
Today I watched a play about
a woman dumping her husband.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.780
In the play, the couple loved each other

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.940
and got along very well at the first.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.100
But another guy fell in love
with the woman later,

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.300
which caused a big trouble to the family,

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.900
and the husband even got dumped in the end.

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.020
I did some thinking.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.620
It's because the husband was too petty;

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.020
he wasn't generous enough.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.820
Huayuan City applauds for men's virtues.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.540
So I'm going to abide by the local rule here.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.300
I invited Meng Guo, Su Ziying and Pei Heng

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.340
here

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.740
so that I can ask them

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.900
what they would do

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.060
if they were in the same situation?

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.340
That's unbelievable!

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.500
I can't stand this kinda thing...

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.340
Shut your mouth!

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.940
No one thinks you are dumb.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.020
You scared me!

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.980
Young Master Han, don't worry.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.860
I admit that I was up to no good

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.140
to Her Highness.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.100
But how can I compare to her

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.340
childhood sweetheart Minister Pei,

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.180
or you, her newly-wed husband,

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.820
or even a "fine lady" like him.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.100
Meng,

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.580
if you don't know idioms,

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.620
stop using them.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.460
But, Her Highness treats me

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:41.860
very well,

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.260
if there's any misunderstanding,

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.180
hope you'll forgive me.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.220
Now, let me toast to all of you!

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:50.780
Cheers!

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:56.580
What about you?

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.940
Although I once belonged to Minister Pei,

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.980
I've been sent to serve Her Highness,

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.140
so I'll be loyal to Her Highness.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.420
Whoever Her Highness chooses,

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.580
I'll go with her choice.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.620
You are playing fire, you know that?

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:17.780
Minster Pei,

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.180
what do you think

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:21.900
of the dumping husband thing?

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.940
I think it's very good!

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.780
OMG, what Pei Heng said
wasn't in line with the plot.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:39.940
Very good!

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.020
Minister Pei meant...

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.540
Minister Pei meant that
the wine was very good!

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.900
Very good?

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.180
Very good!

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.460
Your Highness,

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.220
don't you have anything to say?

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.060
Do I have to?

00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.820
What do you think?

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.900
How can I

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.620
fast-forward this plot?

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:26.860
Han Shuo,

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.660
I know your feelings

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.460
for me.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.580
But many things

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.140
can't be explained.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.500
You can't be too serious.

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.980
I need to protect my public image!

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.340
Right? Pei Heng.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.540
This thing

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.300
is hard to explain.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.460
We can't take it too seriously.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.100
How about I...

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:52.500
Qianqian!

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.380
Her Highness is drunk!

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:57.340
No.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.340
Then let's call it a day.

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.420
We can discuss it some other time.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:07.980
Here!

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.580
Gentlemen, please continue to enjoy the meal.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.660
Your Highness, let me take you to your room.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.780
Here, be careful.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:13.980
I'm leaving, Han Shuo.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.500
Master, take it easy!

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.940
You are getting heavier!

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:23.820
Stop it.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.620
You are not drunk?

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.300
Drunk?

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.500
I've been practicing.

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.900
My capacity for wine is
bigger than my courage now.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.060
By the way, what's new with Su Ziying?

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.220
This Yingying has been acting weirdly.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.460
He tried to get into the study several times.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.900
But Bai Ji and I stopped him.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.700
Then next time, just let him in.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:44.620
I wanna see

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.060
how he's going to harm me.
