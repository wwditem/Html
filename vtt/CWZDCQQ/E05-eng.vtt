=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 5)

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.260
The Second Princess is a good archer.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.060
Her skill is not worse than yours
when you were young.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.020
Good job!

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.900
Your Highness, you have great learning

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.140
and you're good at Kung Fu.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.820
The Crown Princess Election is around the corner.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.900
You have to practice hard.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.940
I hope you can become a military officer.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.460
I still need your support in the future.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.700
Trust me.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.540
We've been friends since childhood.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.220
When you become the Crown Princess,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.620
I'll do all I can to assist you.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.980
As for the Crown Princess Election,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.100
both Qianqian and I are candidates.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.140
It's not known who can be elected.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.700
Just wait and see.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.620
Chen Qianqian couldn't make it.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.540
Don't mention this matter again.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.740
Your Highness.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.820
Chen Qianqian!

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.580
Let's have a competition.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.740
My wound hasn't healed.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.020
When I'm fully recovered,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.420
I'll defeat you to convince you.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.580
When did you become so vulnerable?

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.460
It's just a joint dislocation.
It must have healed already.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.900
You're just afraid

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.300
you'll lose, right?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.380
Me?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.140
Yes, I am.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.020
I won't lose if I don't compete.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.060
Chen Qianqian,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.620
don't you feel ashamed?

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.980
Stay away from Minister Pei.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.100
Why is she...

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.940
She can't...

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.740
Chen Qianqian can't do Kung Fu anymore?

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.660
Mother, you want to see me?

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.380
Qianqian, I hear you've
been diligent these days.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.940
Yes. I've been quite obedient recently.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.860
I've been overcautious

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.460
to avoid making trouble.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.780
I hear

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.300
you've got more musicians in your mansion.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.180
So, you want to live for enjoyment?

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.620
Have you forgotten that

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.420
you're a princess?

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.660
Mother, you're right.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.900
I did it wrong.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.980
No. Mother,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.980
you misunderstood Chuchu.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.100
It's Han Shuo

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.100
that sent those guys to her mansion.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.580
She knew nothing about it.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.900
Alright.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.660
I know you care about your sister.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.860
Stop making excuses for her.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.220
Your Majesty,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.540
as for the Crown Princess Election,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.700
I have a suggestion.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.780
I'm wondering if I should say it out.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.900
Go ahead.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.420
In Huayuan City, women have the decisive say.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.660
Even Minister of Defense

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.020
is a woman.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.580
The Crown Princess, as the future City Owner

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.460
should master both civil and military skills.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.420
But over the years,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.020
only a literacy test
and a discourse on politics

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.100
have been considered
during the Crown Princess Election.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.060
Your Majesty,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.020
how about letting all princesses
take a Kung Fu test?

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.020
A Kung Fu test?

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.220
Both the Second and the Third Princesses
are good at Kung Fu,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.460
especially the latter.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.260
She has extraordinary skill.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.300
In Huayuan,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.820
nobody dares to claim to be the first

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.820
if Chen Qianqian says she ranks second.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.940
Does everyone think

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.460
I'm sure to fail in the competition

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.980
so that they want to give me
a chance to earn extra points?

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.020
How could Lin Qi be so nice to me?

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.740
The Second Princess Chen Chuchu
isn't the Her Majesty's real daughter.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.460
Chen Chuchu isn't her real daughter?

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.780
And Chen Yuanyuan is disabled.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.620
So, Chen Qianqian will be

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.700
the only successor of Huayuan City!

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.980
If we poison Chen Qianqian,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.100
Her Majesty will certainly save her
with the Dragon Bone.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.660
That'll be our chance to take it,

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.460
and your heart disease will be cured finally!

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.060
Young Master,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.340
are you still thinking
about saving your own life

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.820
or Chen Qianqian's?

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.180
As for the tip-off given away,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.500
I've found out who's the one behind that.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.900
Who is it?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.180
Lin Qi, how will they do the Kung Fu test?

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.780
By giving an open challenge.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.380
Oh no. I've given myself away.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.180
Lin Qi has found out I couldn't do Kung Fu.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.660
No.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.740
No way.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.580
It's unfair.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.380
Mother, think about it.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.820
Everyone knows that I'm good at Kung Fu.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.500
If a Kung Fu test is added,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.660
everyone will think I've pulled strings.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.180
It's unfair.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.540
Mother.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.020
Qianqian,

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.260
this is an exception we make for you.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.580
I don't expect you to win out

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.700
in the literacy test
or about discourse on politics.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.860
But the Kung Fu test,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.020
you'll win, right?

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.300
No.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.300
Don't be self-willed.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.540
Qianqian, you're a skilled fighter.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.700
Remember to stop at
where it should when you fight.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.380
Don't get others seriously injured.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.380
What if

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.860
I'm injured by others?

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.020
You naughty girl.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.100
If you let others do that on purpose,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.060
I'll give you a heavy punishment.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.340
Alright. So much for today.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.100
No.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.580
Lin Qi.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.900
Your Highness,

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.900
your mother agreed to add a Kung Fu test

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.780
because she has placed great hopes on you.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.460
Don't let her down.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.740
Qianqian.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.460
Chuchu.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.100
When Lin Qi proposed to add a Kung Fu test,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.180
why didn't you object to it?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.740
It's against you.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.660
Mother hasn't gone far.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.340
Let's go talk to her.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.220
Hurry.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.780
A successor should be adept with both the pen
and the sword to convince people.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.700
It's understandable to add a Kung Fu test.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.980
If the two of us become rivals
during the test,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.900
don't let me win

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.580
just because I'm your sister.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.100
I wish I could do this.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.060
You're forcing a donkey to dance.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.620
We've been fighting since childhood.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.740
I'm glad we'll finally have a showdown

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.780
with each other in an impressive way.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.220
See you on the arena.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.420
Life has finally decided to

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.540
teach me a good lesson.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.620
Your Highness.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.860
What's up?

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.300
You look unhappy.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.260
No way.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.180
I have to figure out a way
to avoid the Kung Fu test.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.140
Han Shuo.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.300
He can help me out.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.260
Where did you get it?

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.580
In the backyard's kitchen.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.260
The grocery guy said

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.060
it was custom-made for Zi Rui,
Chen Qianqian's servant.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.540
He's ordered 500.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.340
All of them are piled in the backyard.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.100
I heard

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.100
Chuchu was going to catch
a spy of Xuanhu City

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.140
and I specially went to help you out.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.700
I had no idea you'd put me in that situation.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.860
Han Shuo,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.980
I've really taken pains to help you.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.580
Why on earth did you try to save me?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.220
Because I'm on your side.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.100
Could it be

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.780
she misled me on purpose

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.780
to gain my trust?

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.620
Not only do I know your birthday date,

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.140
I also know you are 186cm in height,

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.620
you weigh 75 kg, your blood type is O.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.020
You like black,

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.620
don't like rainy days,

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.140
your favorite food is noodle soup
cooked by your mom,

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.420
you don't like ginger.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.180
No wonder she knows me well.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.580
It turns out she has investigated me.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.580
She's making a fool of me.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.900
The Third Princess

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.900
is not guarded against me at all.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.620
She even induced me to lower my guard.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.740
She's sinister and insidious.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.420
Seemingly, she was devoted to me
and got me out of trouble,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.020
but actually, she framed me

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.540
with a tip-off.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.700
Young Master,

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.260
the doctor said

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.340
you couldn't lose your temper.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.740
Chen Qianqian is just a bitch.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.180
Young Master.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.020
Han Shuo, help me.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.100
I don't want to compete.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.020
I don't want to do tests.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.740
I don't want to be the Crown Princess.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.740
Is he asleep?

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.660
Your Highness.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.820
You're asking me to save him?

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.380
If anything happens to him,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.700
I won't leave it at that.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.660
Han Shuo.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.100
Zi Rui.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.140
Go away.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.740
Han Shuo.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.940
Beast!

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.420
Let go of our Young Master.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.660
Can't you see he's in danger?

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.620
Go open the window wider
and give him more fresh air.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.260
Hurry.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.340
Go open the window wider
and give him more fresh air.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.140
Hurry.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.980
Han Shuo. Where is the medicine?

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.220
Quick-Acting Heart Reliever
or Ginseng lozenge.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.340
Anything that can save his life.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.700
Medicine. Hurry up.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.580
Here it is.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.740
Such a big pill?

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.740
He's fainted. Do you want
to choke him to death?

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.940
Please save...

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.300
The taste...

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.180
You're awake?

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.220
You're finally awake.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.700
You can't die, Han Shuo.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.620
Luckily...

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.140
Don't you want to see me die?

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.980
Stop your false display of affection.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.820
This...

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.900
This bamboo tube...

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.820
Right.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.020
Bamboo tube.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.420
Someone made a sealing wax bamboo tube

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.460
and tried to frame me for colluding
with Xuanhu's spy.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.660
Do you still remember?

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:29.780
I'm done for.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.620
You knew it?

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.260
I'm done for.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.180
Why did I say it out?

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.020
How will you explain it?

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.300
Why did you frame me?

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.900
Why did you lie to me?

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.940
Don't panic.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.260
Let me think about it.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.220
I...

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.220
I did it wrong.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:02.900
Your Highness,

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.140
even if you did it wrong,

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.380
you can't kneel down.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.980
Girls of Huayuan are dignified.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.660
You can only kneel to Heaven,
Earth and Her Majesty.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.140
How can you kneel to your husband?

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.180
Get up.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.460
My legs are too weak. I can't stand up.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:16.740
Get up.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.740
My legs are weak.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.220
I really did it wrong.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.100
I don't understand.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.980
What did you do wrong?

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.660
As for you colluding with Xuanhu's spy,

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.740
I made it up.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.500
I told Chuchu to catch you,

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.860
but I really didn't put any defense map

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.060
on the boat.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.940
I couldn't really get you into trouble.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.940
I know you've known the truth.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.340
I didn't aim to hide you from it,

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.380
or

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.700
I must have long destroyed

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.900
such an obvious evidence.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.140
Right?

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.780
Yes. That's right.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.660
If we aimed to hide you,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.660
we couldn't have ordered 500 bamboo tubes.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.180
Right.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.580
And we couldn't have
placed them in the backyard.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.620
I'm not stupid.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.460
Five hundred?

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.460
In the backyard?

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.900
That explains how they found it out.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.900
Come on. You and Bai Ji
are really a good match.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.780
Han Shuo,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.980
do you know why I did that?

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.740
Why?

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.020
I just wanted you

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.740
to think highly of me.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.860
Since the first time we met,

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.900
I've known from your eyes that

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.460
you dislike me.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.660
I don't care what other people think of me.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.660
But I don't want you to look down upon me

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.580
or misunderstand me.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.540
I tried to frame you,

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.580
just because I wanted to have a chance

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.140
to save you

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.700
after putting you in trouble.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.140
In this case, you'd change
your attitude towards me

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.260
and trust me more.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.100
Right?

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.100
Do you mean

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.420
you framed me

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.260
to win my favor?

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.940
You can say that.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.620
Colluding with the enemy is a capital crime.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.860
How can you do that

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.780
to show your affection for me?

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.460
I'm afraid

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.020
I can't afford to bear it.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.540
We won't believe you again.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.900
I know

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.980
I did it in a very stupid way.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.980
If you really don't believe me,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.060
I'll order them

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.140
to make fireworks

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.260
with the rest 498 bamboo tubes

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.740
to show my apology, okay?

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.980
Great.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.900
What do you mean?

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.540
I mean the moonlight tonight will be great.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.100
How about you and me

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.860
enjoy the glorious moon in the garden?

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.620
And then?

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.900
We can drink some vintage wine.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.740
(Qingfeng Tea House)

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.740
Dear all,

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.180
here is the story.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.020
After knowing that orange
made a fool of him,

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.100
banana changed his mind again
and decided to kill her.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.300
Is there anything

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.100
we can do to turn the tide

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.980
so that orange can be saved?

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.700
Orange is really tough.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.260
I can't believe she's still alive.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.580
It's because banana is
so merciful and kind-hearted

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.980
as to spare her life.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.300
She framed him

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.140
and then deceived him with sweet words.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.420
She deserves more than death.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.380
You can't say that.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.180
It's not all orange's fault.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.900
She didn't mean it. Right?

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.620
She has a stupid teammate

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.540
who got things wrong.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.180
Your Highness,

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.620
do you know

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.420
what banana's Achilles' heel is?

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.580
He is born with a weak heart.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.740
He couldn't live to 20.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.660
If orange helps banana get cured,

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.740
he may give up the idea of killing her.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.580
Your Highness,

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.780
when we create a story,

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.100
we'll let the protagonists return
a favor with a favor.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.300
You're nice to him

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.220
and he'll pay you back.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.780
But I'm not a doctor.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.420
There is no medicine that can cure him.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.940
How can I get...

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.500
Dragon Bone?

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.100
Oh, my god.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.940
One of the main reasons

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.220
Han Shuo agreed to marry into Huayuan City

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.580
was to get Dragon Bone

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.900
and cure himself.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.820
In my original script,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.580
Chuchu made a lot of preparations
to get Dragon Bone for Han Shuo

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.460
after she became the Crown Princess.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.620
Then he began to regard her
with special respect.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.460
If I can get Dragon Bone

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.900
and cure Han Shuo's heart disease,

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.700
he's sure to let me go.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.820
What's wrong?

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.580
Your Highness,

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.700
Dragon Bone is Huayuan City's
most precious treasure.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.660
To stop others casting greedy eyes on it,

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.900
only Her Majesty and her successor

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.580
know where it is.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.340
We're just common people.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.940
We even don't dare to dream of it,

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.140
let alone write it down in a story.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.180
Dragon Bone can never be used

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.140
to cure any disease.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.540
Your Highness,

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.980
such a thing has never happened before.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.820
It can, because I said so.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.500
Who am I?

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.620
I'm the Third Princess
who's afraid of nothing.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.660
Get up.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.300
Your Highness, please think twice.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.900
Get up.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.380
Do you know how to eat a banana?

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.260
By peeling it.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.500
Exactly. By peeling it.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.020
This time, I'll peel him.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.100
How dare he fight a screenwriter?

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.660
Let me show you how
I'll become a drama queen.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.740
Dragon Bone.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.780
Dragon Bone protects Huayuan.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.060
Dragon Bone...

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.100
Enough. Madam. It's annoying.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.340
Your Highness,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.140
Dragon Bone is Huayuan City's rare treasure.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.940
It's been handed down for generations.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.100
Only Her Majesty
and the Crown Princess can touch it.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.180
I remember it's put here
according to the script.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.900
What does it look like?

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.420
Could it be...

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.300
Dragon Bone is not here.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.380
Right. It's not here.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.460
Not here?

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.340
Stop lying.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.980
Drop the act.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.220
Dragon Bone must be here.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.740
Your Highness, you can't do this.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.300
Your Highness.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.420
Your Highness,

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.580
your mother has told you about this?

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.300
Is it all cut and dried

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.740
before the Crown Princess Election is held?

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.180
Your Highness, stop searching.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.620
Please, Your Highness.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.940
Your Highness, think twice.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.260
Dragon Bone is Huayuan City's
most precious treasure.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.380
It'll be handed on from age to age.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.540
If you want to touch it,

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.380
you must take a bath and burn incense.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.980
You must also ask the Administration
of Heavenly Observatory about a lucky day.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.580
And you need Her Majesty's approval

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.980
and all officials to be there
as eyewitnesses.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.980
If

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.780
Her Majesty doesn't approve

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.300
or the Administration of Heavenly Observatory
can't find a lucky day,

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.700
anyone who touches it will be executed.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.020
You'll be killed, Your Highness.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.420
It...

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.780
That's the relics...

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.620
Beautiful.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.340
...found among the cremated ashes of

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.780
your great-grandmother after she passed away.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.500
Amitabha.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.660
Your Highness.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.140
I did it wrong.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.380
It...

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.660
Your Highness,

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.620
this is the colorful coronet used
by the first City Owner

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.700
when she founded Huayuan City.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.140
It has no equal in this world.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.900
I'm sorry.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.700
I'll put it back.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.620
It...

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.980
It's easy. I was too excited.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.660
I didn't touch her.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.620
Sorry.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.500
I'm sorry.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.460
Sorry.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.100
Your Highness.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.700
Your Highness, please spare us.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.100
You can't do that.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.580
Your Highness.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.540
Dragon Bone?

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.300
Your Highness.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.340
Heaven wants to destroy Huayuan!

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.260
I can't live anymore.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.500
I have to die at my post.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.540
Don't.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.020
If I don't die today,

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.540
I'm sure to report it to Her Majesty.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.940
Don't let her go anywhere.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:01.940
Sorry, madam.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.780
No wonder they say

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.540
the Third Princess can't be entrusted
with any important post.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.620
Your Highness, you've got Dragon Bone.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.700
What to do?

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.700
Stew it.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:15.660
Okay. Stew it.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.820
Stew...

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.860
Your Highness, please spare us.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.060
Spare my life.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.260
Fine.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.780
You cowards.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.380
I won't get you into trouble.
I'll do it myself.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.100
Heat up water.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.420
Add star anise to remove the fishy flavor.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.980
Don't, Your Highness.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.420
Think twice, Your Highness.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.140
Why does it stink so much?

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.380
Is it edible?

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.540
Anyway, we're stewing it.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:05.660
Your Highness.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.340
Young Master Han has prepared
good wine and delicacies.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.780
He asked me to take you to the garden.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.900
What will be, will be.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.100
Okay.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.620
Tell your Young Master

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:24.660
I'll...

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.420
I'll be there soon.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:28.980
Got it.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.980
I tried to show my concern for him,

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.540
but he wants to kill me.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.020
Such being the case,

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.900
get me a chair.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.020
What does Her Highness want to do?

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:48.780
Mind your own business.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.900
She even dares to stew Dragon Bone.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.380
There is nothing she doesn't dare to do.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.980
Prop master, is the wine prepared?

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:55.900
Yes, it is.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.740
As you wish,

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.740
it's a cup of water. You couldn't get drunk.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.900
Actor, have you recited your lines?

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.780
It's a little long,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.780
but I'm good at it.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.020
I still need a special effect artist.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:04.500
You.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.380
Go boil down some syrup.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.660
Make it thicker and redder.
Like real blood. Got it?

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:09.820
Got it.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.300
Besides, have the bamboo tubes been remade?

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.860
Yes, as you ordered.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:13.820
Four hundred and ninety-eight bangs.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.860
You can count if you don't believe.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.140
Next, it depends on my
on-the-spot performance.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.260
Tonight, in the garden,

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.380
do everything at my command.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.020
Obey my orders.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.580
We have to succeed at one go.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.500
There is no second chance.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.300
Got it?

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.020
-Got it. -Got it.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.100
Remember.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.380
Fireworks will be our signal.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:48.940
Remember.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.580
Fireworks will be our signal.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.420
This time, either we succeed
in catching Xuanhu's spy,

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.940
or we die.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.340
Even so, you don't need to risk your life.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.140
Everything has been set.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.780
There is no risk at all.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.340
It's heavily guarded.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:08.980
Remember.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.100
Without my order,

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.100
don't act rashly to give away yourselves.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:13.740
Set out.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:14.980
Got it.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.660
What?

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:20.860
You can leave.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.580
Why so flustered?

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.900
I knew Chuchu

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.820
had gone to catch Xuanhu's spy.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.020
The Third Princess...

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.300
She...

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.740
What could she do to shock you?

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.540
She can just cause some tiny little troubles.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.060
There is nothing to be surprised at.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.820
The Third Princess...

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.940
She broke into the ancestral hall.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.940
Did she tear it down?

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.780
She took Dragon Bone away.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.860
She's so disobedient.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.620
I'll hit her to death today.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.860
Let's go to Yueli Mansion.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:00.460
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.100
Han Shuo, sorry for having kept you waiting.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.580
Han Shuo.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.220
I'll ask you for the last time.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.700
I'm feeling a little under the weather.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.620
Is it okay

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.420
if I don't drink?

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.060
I took the good wine here from Xuanhu City.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.900
It's top-quality.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.100
Have a taste.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.020
There is no harm in trying it.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.020
Okay.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.700
In this case,

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.820
you know what I'm like when I get drunk,

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.300
so I'll make things clear before we start.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.820
I know I'm stupid.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.340
I'm good for nothing.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.700
I'm terrible at studying.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.460
I often go to the Music and Dance Academy.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.780
My mother often scolded me.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.220
She said it was difficult
to alter my character

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.980
and I was hopeless,

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.780
like scrap iron.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.580
I think you did a good job,

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.580
especially in playing dumb
to get what you want.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.780
It's amazing.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.620
Well. You too.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.820
Drinking three cups of wine is
a good way to show respect.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.300
I'll drink up three cups first.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.300
Han Shuo, since you came here,

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.500
you've been having a rough time.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.140
Actually,

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.660
the first time

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.980
I saw you and decided to marry you,

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.860
I've found that you're in poor health

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.940
by observing your looks.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.020
After these days we spent together,

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.300
I found out

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.020
you had always been bothered
by your heart disease.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.260
It makes me quite worried.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.180
Don't.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.380
I haven't finished my words.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.620
Han Shuo,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.820
I know I did a lot of things wrong,

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.900
but I was forced to.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.620
You're so broad-minded and generous

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.820
that you've forgiven me,

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.540
but I still feel very guilty deep inside.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.140
As the saying goes,

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.860
one day together as husband and wife
means endless devotion the rest of your life.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.020
A couple is a team.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:25.820
I'll definitely think about your interests

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.580
no matter what I do.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.180
So,

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.140
I've got you

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.380
a guiding drug

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.820
to make sure you can be cured

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.300
and the two of us will
live together until old age.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.060
To cure my disease,

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.300
you have to get one thing.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:46.460
Do you know what it is?

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.100
Dragon Bone.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.380
I've got it for you.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.060
You must be joking.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.020
Dragon Bone is so precious.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.540
How could you get it so easily?

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.780
You don't believe?

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.220
In this case,

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.540
you can go have a look in the kitchen.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.820
It's being stewed.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.260
Based on the cooking time,

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.860
I think it's almost ready.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.540
If you're interested,

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.740
you can also smell it.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.500
Young Master,

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.500
a pot of water turns into a bowl of soup.

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.700
All the essence is condensed here.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.980
Dragon Bone

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.140
is Huayuan City's most precious treasure.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.580
Did Chen Qianqian really get it
for our Young Master?

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.780
Of course.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.380
It's absolutely true.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.420
Legend has it that

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.260
the first City Owner of Huayuan

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.380
found this medicinal material by accident.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.420
It can remove all poison
and cure all disease.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.860
It's considered as an auspicious sign
and named Dragon Bone.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.020
The founder of Huayuan got Dragon Bone

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.380
and then the black stone mine

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.500
before she founded the city.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.140
Every City Owner of Huayuan believes

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.540
the city is safe because of Dragon Bone

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.060
and the city develops because of the mine.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.020
You can keep exploiting the mine,

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.380
but there is only one piece of Dragon Bone.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.380
Don't you think it's precious?

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.180
Stop bragging.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.980
Pitifully,

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.740
the Third Princess has stewed Dragon Bone

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.260
so that Young Master Han can get cured,

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.540
but what will she do

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.940
when her mother blames her

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.020
for doing that?

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.540
The smell explains why it's most precious.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.060
Is Chen Qianqian really so nice to me?

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.540
Young Master, she's still in the garden.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.420
Damn.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.220
The terrain is open ahead.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.460
Let's branch out into two columns.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.980
Launch a converging attack
when you see fireworks.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:09.980
Be careful.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.820
Don't let them find us and escape.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.460
Got it.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.820
Want to fight me?

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.700
Now that you're a character in a script,

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.140
the screenwriter has the final say.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.500
Even if you force me into a corner,

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.420
I can still

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.420
turn things around.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.500
Qianqian, no!

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:54.940
Qianqian.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.820
Han Shuo.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.860
The wine is poisoned. Don't drink it.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.740
Han Shuo.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:14.980
Be careful!

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.460
Qianqian. Qianqian.

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.140
Qianqian.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.700
Chen Qianqian, don't die!

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:01.900
Hurry up.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:02.940
Hurry.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.820
(Yueli Mansion)
Hurry.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:06.820
Your Majesty.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.860
Why did I have such a disobedient daughter?

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.140
Go to the kitchen.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.980
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.260
(Yueli Mansion)

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.420
Can you get Dragon Bone out?

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.500
Please spare my life.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.620
It's melted.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.260
The Third Princess ordered us to do it.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:31.780
What a disobedient girl.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.540
I'll beat her to death,

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.900
or I don't deserve to be the City Owner.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.860
Your Majesty.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.060
Your Majesty, the Third Princess is poisoned.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.060
What?

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.140
How is she doing?

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.700
I'm not sure if she's alive or not.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:42.580
It...

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.460
Your Majesty, don't panic.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.580
Dragon Bone can remove all poison
and cure all disease.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.100
Send for Yuanyuan.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:47.500
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.140
Sangqi,

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.500
take Dragon Bone and follow me.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.340
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.020
You good-for-nothings.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.820
Your Highness, what do you think?

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.740
I don't think it's fatal.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.260
As for the rest,

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.940
I'm not sure.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.380
Hurry. Take Dragon Bone here.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.380
Young Master.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:36.980
Han Shuo,

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.820
Dragon Bone is Huayuan City's
most precious treasure.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.100
It can remove all poison
and cure all disease.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.380
There has been only one piece
in the past 1,000 years.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.580
I see.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.780
Qianqian got it for you

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.180
at the risk of her life.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.700
Won't you take it

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.580
to cure your heart disease?

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.220
She has done so much for me.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.700
I can't let her die like this.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.220
As I said, the Third Princess is alright.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.180
Dragon Bone deserves its reputation.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.460
It works like a charm.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.460
Maybe I'm not seriously poisoned,

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.340
so I get better with only one sip.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:08.620
Han Shuo,

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.940
it can cure your heart disease.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.220
Take it.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.700
It took me so much effort

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.220
to get Dragon Bone,

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.940
but you're not grateful at all.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.580
Take it now.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.580
I don't dare to.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.900
My only wish

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.900
is to cure your heart disease.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.900
If you don't take it,

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.740
I'll be heartbroken. I feel dizzy.
I want to die.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.780
Your Highness, calm down.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.940
Anxiety is bad for your health.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.940
Take it.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.340
She's threatening you with her own life.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:00.860
Under the circumstances...

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.780
I know.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.740
I know I let you down

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.580
because of the bamboo tube thing.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.700
I feel guilty of you.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.860
When you had heart attacks that day...

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.460
I don't have the heart to see you suffer.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.260
Drink the Dragon Bone soup.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.100
Drink it immediately.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.860
Otherwise, it will become stinkier when it's cold.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:42.380
How are you feeling?

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.820
Are you feeling full of energy?

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.020
I'm not feeling anything special.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.860
It's just...

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.820
You've taken Dragon Bone.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.420
Your heart disease will be cured.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.300
You're sure to recover

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.140
after taking Dragon Bone.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.300
In this case,

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.700
I'll

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.660
be relieved.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.020
Hurry.

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.700
Mother?

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.980
Qianqian, you're really awake?

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.340
Mother, I'm fine.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.140
Go back and rest up.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.420
Qianqian,

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.300
you're feeling sorry for me now?

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.380
Why didn't you think about me

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.180
when you decided to stew Dragon Bone?

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.340
It has been handed down
for so many generations,

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.180
but now it's destroyed.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.340
How should I explain to my ancestors?

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.100
How could the common people and officials

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.300
let you go?

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.900
Mother, I did it wrong. I'm sorry.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:51.940
Your Majesty.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.740
Take it.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.060
Mother.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.460
Don't be afraid.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.500
You've just stewed one piece of Dragon Bone.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.700
I'll protect you.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.580
As long as I'm here,

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.060
nobody can hurt you.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.460
Alright. Take it.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.100
Here.
