=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 20)

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.420
(Music and Dance Academy)

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.220
That day,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.540
Your Highness took my lady away

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.500
right from this room.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.020
It's only been half a month since,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.740
Miss Lin was killed,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.660
Young Master Han conquered the city,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.020
and you were detained.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.820
What a turn of events!

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.460
Things are the same, yet people are no more.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.260
If it wasn't for the death of Lin Qi,

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.300
I wouldn't have to trick
Han Shuo into leaving,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.100
and make things turn out like this.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.260
Butler Lin, may her rest in peace!

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.820
When the Second Princess
was determined to kill my lady,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.900
it was Your Highness who saved her.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.700
Although you decided to exile her,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.180
before she left,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.140
you gave her a golden token.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.140
Even though my lady

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.020
was still killed in the end,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.700
we do owe you one.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.900
I will never forget that.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.020
Open the door.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.780
Butler Lin, someone sent this brocade box

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.180
and asked me to give it to you.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.180
Alright.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.220
Your Highness!

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.980
The golden token I gave to Lin Qi?

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.500
Look at this.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.940
(The letter represents me. I'm doing fine.
I'm at Xuanhu City. Don't miss me.)

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.900
"The letter represents me. I'm doing fine."

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.660
Lin Qi is alive!

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.140
My lady is alive?!

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.020
That's so great!

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.460
The Lins won't be childless now!

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.700
Lin Qi is...

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.220
Wait! Wait a sec!

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.900
Wait a sec!

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.900
Calm down! I need to clear my mind!

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.940
Why would I make Han Shuo leave?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.500
Because I thought

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.020
the plots were out of my control.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.340
I was afraid that Han Shuo
would end up in the plots I wrote.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.540
But where did I get that idea?

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.740
Because...

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.700
Because my mother had a stroke,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.620
Lu Peng died, and Lin Qi also died.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.980
But I wrote all of those.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.380
However, my mother has recovered,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.460
it's proved that Chuchu killed Lu Peng,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.620
and Lin Qi didn't die.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.180
Lin Qi is alive!

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.620
It means I can change the fate
of the characters!

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.260
It means Han Shuo

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.740
won't end up in the pre-set plots!

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.020
So, what's the point of fighting with Han Shuo?

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.380
Qianqian, what's wrong?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.020
Your Highness, aren't you happy

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.980
that my lady is alive?

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.980
I am happy.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.380
But I don't think

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.340
your lady and I will get along.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.900
Look the letter she wrote. What is that?

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.060
She's fine, but I'm not!

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.140
Pei Heng,

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.860
I have to go back.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.700
Go back to Yueli Mansion?

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.820
Qianqian, don't be willful.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.820
It took me great efforts
to get you out of there!

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.660
Han Shuo is like a wild animal now.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.220
You want to become his prey again?

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.340
It's hard to explain to you

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.140
what happened between us.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.060
Han Shuo humiliated you so badly.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.460
Why do you have to go back?

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.020
Because it was just a misunderstanding!

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.860
He won't treat me like that anymore

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.540
once we talk it out.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.660
I can't watch you

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.340
jumping into the fire pit again.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.020
But I have to go back.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.700
Butler Lin,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.500
is there any way to get me back
to Yueli Mansion

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.820
without letting other people know?

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.860
How did you get out of there then?

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.820
Pei Heng, I'm sorry!

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.100
Qianqian, don't go!

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.980
Qianqian!

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.580
Qianqian!

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.060
(A pure heart and spirit)

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.220
The situation is settled now.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.100
You are already my prisoner.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.220
Between the City Owner Seal and your life,

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.140
which one is more important?

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.060
I believe that you are a smart person.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.220
You will make a smart choice.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.620
To ordinary people,

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.260
life is certainly more important.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.620
But as the owner of Huayuan City,

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.860
I'm responsible for the future of our city.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.500
To me,

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.180
the City Owner Seal

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.700
is surely more important than my life!

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.100
If you are being stubborn,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.140
then don't blame me for being harsh.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.500
Then why don't you just kill me?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.420
You think I don't dare?

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.340
I'm not afraid of death,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.940
but my poor youngest daughter Qianqian

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.700
will have to deal with the pain
of losing her mother.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.060
She will cry about it

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.100
for three days!

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.660
Are you threatening me?

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.540
Young Master,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.900
you just said

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.500
that you were the knife, and I was the meat.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.060
You are the one
who's threatening me right now.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.900
Good!

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.860
Women in Huayuan City are known

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.260
as tactful and crafty.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.300
I've seen it up close many times.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.420
Your Majesty, take good care.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.340
About the City Owner Seal,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.540
I'll figure out another way.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.540
But Qianqian is such a filial daughter.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.100
Though you spare my life today,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.140
during this chaotic time,

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.620
if someone else

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.580
killed me,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.140
Qianqian would still

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.700
blame you for it.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.180
If my death caused discord
between you and Qianqian,

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.900
how could I

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.380
rest in peace after I died?

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.660
You are indeed a cunning woman!

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.700
In that case,

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.180
I can't kill you,

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.940
instead, I actually have to protect you.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.580
Don't flatter me.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.300
You were able to

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.100
conquer the city overnight,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.300
it shows you hid your evil plan very well.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.060
I don't even trust my own daughters,

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.620
let alone trust you to protect me.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.460
Carefully guard her bedroom!

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.580
No one is allowed to be out

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.500
or in!

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.380
Yes!

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.860
Why are you coming back?

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.060
We forgot our instruments.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.260
Go get them now, and then leave!

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.380
Are you here to pick me up?

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.260
Hurry!

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.020
Your Highness, how come you are back, too?

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.820
I don't have time to explain!

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.980
Let's change our clothes back.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.540
Just pretend that nothing has happened.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.860
Do not let Han Shuo find out!

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.460
If he does,

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.060
just tell him

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.740
that you forced me to go,

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.340
but I refused determinedly

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.900
and said I wouldn't go anywhere,

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.580
I'd only stay with Han Shuo!

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.300
Got it?

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.580
Yes!

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.060
Well. Listen.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.300
Han... Han Shuo, please let me explain.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.740
I didn't want to run away, I...

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.380
You've changed your clothes.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.140
How could you say you didn't want to?

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.180
I did run away, but I came back.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.340
Will you believe me?

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.820
Bai Ji.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.780
Young Master!

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.780
Your Highness!

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.580
You've put on the musician's clothes
and try to run away?

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:40.900
Young Master.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.340
Thank God that I've been guarding this place

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.180
without even blinking my eyes.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.660
She almost succeeded.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.420
Whose idea?

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.900
Not like that! Han Shuo, listen to me.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.940
Young Master, please spare my life!

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.860
Minister Pei asked me to do it!

00:09:59.140 --> 00:09:59.860
Pei Heng?

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.700
No! No!

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.060
You were going to run away with Pei Heng?

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.100
Where to?

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.140
Pei Heng has nothing to do with it!

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.460
Bai Ji.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.100
Take the musicians away.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:10.940
Yes.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.460
Follow me.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.060
Please don't be angry!

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.540
Let me explain.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.700
I... I actually...

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:22.700
Wait!

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.940
You were playing the same trick again, right?

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.940
You were first dressed
as Pei Heng's servant and ran away.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.380
This time, you were dressed as a musician.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.900
And both times, Pei Heng was involved.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.700
Looks like you really trust him a lot!

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.820
No! Han Shuo, it's a misunderstanding!

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.140
I promise I'll be with you in the future.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.420
I won't go anywhere, okay?

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.300
I once loved you,

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.660
respected you, cherished you,
and cared about you.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.220
But you

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.780
betrayed me, deceived me,
cheated me, and fooled me.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.900
Apparently you think
that I can't live without you!

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.060
Since you could give up on my love

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.580
for the interest of the two cities,

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.460
I think I don't have to be merciful
to you anymore.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.860
I'd rather consummate
our relationship right now,

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.060
in case you'll run away again!

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.340
(Divorce Letter)

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.100
You are still gonna use
the divorce letter to threaten me?

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.540
You...

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.500
If you want to consummate our relationship,

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.020
then do it!

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:52.700
You...

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.460
Can't believe you'd do this for Pei Heng!

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.180
How is this related to Pei Heng?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.780
Then you are doing this for your mother!

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.020
You think by doing this,

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.900
you can save her?

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:08.980
No!

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.180
It's totally irrelevant to my mother!

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.940
Chen Qianqian.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.340
I underestimated you!

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.900
Can't believe you are shameless like this!

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.220
You'd use your body to make a deal with me!

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.940
Make a deal?

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.820
Han Shuo, I am being serious!

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.300
You are humiliating yourself!

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.460
Humiliating myself?

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.980
Since you don't want to be my woman...

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.140
I want to be!

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.660
...then you can be my slave.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.260
That

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.420
is not an option！

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.620
From now on,

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.300
all chores, including
heating up water, cooking,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.340
doing laundry and making bed,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.980
will be

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.660
your responsibilities.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.580
Hey, have you even been listening to me?

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.940
You should've seen it coming!

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.740
Stop!

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.020
Han Shuo.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.260
I lowered myself yet you are still leaving?

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.100
I also have dignity, okay?

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.540
Luckily I controlled myself!

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.220
Why did you come out again?

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.900
Well, the Second Princess is here.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.340
She's waiting for you in the study right now.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.700
Ask Chen Qianqian to serve her.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.100
Yes.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.660
As long as our misunderstanding is addressed,

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.740
everything will be back to the way it was.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.540
Young Master Han,

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.980
since you and Qianqian have divorced,

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.580
it's not proper for you to live together.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.100
Why don't you...

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:02.700
Chen Qianqian!

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.540
Come out!

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.540
Chuchu, long time no see.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.620
Why were you eavesdropping by the door?

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.300
I wasn't.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.420
You asked me to be here to serve.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.780
Then what are you waiting for?
Pour us some tea.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.860
Chuchu, what were you going to say?

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.340
Why don't you send Qianqian
to Risheng Mansion

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.100
to live with Yuanyuan?

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.580
Good idea!

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.100
Whatever you say.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.260
I'll listen to you!

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.780
I didn't expect you'd agree so quickly.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.740
She's just a toy to me.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.540
I can put her anywhere I want.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.140
Sounds like you

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.180
really don't like her anymore.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.700
Do you need me to prove it to you?

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.340
So, when are you going to

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.700
send Qianqian to Risheng Mansion?

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.700
No hurry.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.780
Though she's a toy,

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.380
it's more fun to keep her at hand.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.180
Then how about

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.260
you move to Xingzi Mansion?

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.540
It'll be convenient for us
to discuss the city matters.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.340
Are you

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.860
treating me as a man of Huayuan City

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.500
so that you can boss me around?

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.100
What you did was just an act
to piss off Qianqian, wasn't it?

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.300
Looks like you just treated me
as a woman of Xuanhu City

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.940
and bossed me around.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.340
I still have things to do.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.340
Your Highness, please see yourself out.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.140
Men are so unreliable

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.300
and unpredictable!

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.780
I feel hurt!

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.740
But I must have hurt him even more

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.620
when I gave him the divorce letter.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.780
It's karma.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.340
Your Highness,

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.620
Young Master is calling you over

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.460
to help him change clothes.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:27.780
Please.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.060
Is it too tight, Young Master?

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.060
-It feels good.
-Really?

00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.740
-Yes.
-Okay!

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.180
Get me a cup of tea!

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.820
Alright!

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.660
Young Master, please.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.660
Why is it so hot?

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.140
Is it?

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.260
I'm sorry!

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.300
Chen Qianqian,

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.940
do you think I have no way to deal with you?

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.540
How come?

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.060
You are such a powerful man.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.220
You conquered Huayuan City
and detained my mother.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.300
You also threaten me every day
with little white bottles.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.540
My life

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.660
is totally

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.060
at your mercy.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.140
As long as you know it, Chen Qianqian!

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.900
Even if you die,

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.980
I'll let you die in my hands.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.380
Don't even think about
getting out of Yueli Mansion!

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:02.700
Now,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.380
go iron my clothes.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.900
If I see any wrinkle,

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.300
you can forget about sleeping tonight!

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.460
Men asking women to do housework
is really a tradition

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.220
that's never changed since ancient times!

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.260
I'm exhausted!

00:19:59.260 --> 00:19:59.860
Oh no!

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.540
Her Majesty is resting.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.700
Please go back, Your Highness!

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.300
Why couldn't I go into my mother's bedroom?

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.900
When did you replace the guards

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.780
with your own people?

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.660
You are Her Majesty's daughter.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.860
If one day you change your mind,

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.500
I'll have to at least keep a hostage.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.500
To you,

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.980
Chen Qianqian is already a hostage!

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.140
Isn't it enough

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.060
to have her?

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.100
But Chen Qianqian is not a threat to you.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.660
I think you've changed your mind.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.460
We made a deal

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.900
that we'd get the abdication decree

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.540
from my mother.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.020
But now,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.780
Mother still hasn't issue the decree.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.780
The decree can be forged,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.620
but not the seal.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.100
Without the seal,

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.540
those old officials

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.700
won't accept me as the new City Owner.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.020
What will you do

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.460
if Her Majesty doesn't hand you the seal?

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.820
My mother cares about Chen Qianqian the most.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.420
I'll use Chen Qianqian's life
to threaten her!

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.100
If she refuses to give me the seal,

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.300
I'll cut off one finger
of Chen Qianqian every day

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.180
and show it to my mother.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.700
That way, I'm sure

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.820
she'll hand the seal to me within three days!

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.220
But, it'll depend on

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.860
if you will feel bad for her.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.380
You are such a good sister!

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.300
As I expected, you do pity her!

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.660
Don't forget our deal!

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.980
If I can't become the City Owner,

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.740
you will never get

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.740
that black water mine!

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.340
I know what I'm doing.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.020
I will help you get the seal.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.260
As long as you keep your promise!

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.180
Although you have your Xuanhu army,

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.260
I also have my Huayuan City Guards.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.980
We certainly don't want to make things ugly.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.460
Mr. Pei, even though we know
Her Highness burned her hand,

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.740
there's nothing we can do!

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.860
Stop!

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.260
Han Shuo!

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:15.780
Mr. Pei!

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.340
Han Shuo!

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:16.780
Mr. Pei!

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.740
What's the matter?

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.780
Han Shuo!

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.500
Han Shuo!

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.740
Mr. Pei!

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.380
Pei Heng.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.620
I haven't got a chance to settle with you

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.740
for abducting my wife,

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.420
yet you

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.460
showed up here yourself.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.020
I shouldn't have let you take Qianqian away!

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.500
You've never really cherished her!

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.020
And now you even tortured her!

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.940
How could you do that?

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.620
I just asked her to do some housework.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.340
How could that be "torture"?

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.180
Aren't the Huayuan women
a little too delicate?

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.980
Qianqian is a princess.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.740
She doesn't know how to do housework.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.860
She even burned herself!

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.380
But you don't care about her at all!

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.620
She got burned?

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.140
How did you know that?

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.300
I must take her away today!

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.500
How do you manage that?

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.140
Pretend to be a musician again

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.740
and take her away by playing music?

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.380
You have no control of any soldier.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.260
You can't even protect yourself,

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.060
let alone the person you love!

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.700
(Yueli Mansion)

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.820
I'm injured,

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.580
yet you are still trying
to consummate our relationship?

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.220
Are you an animal?

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.980
Why didn't you tell me
that you burned your hand?

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.940
Even Pei Heng learned the news before me.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.260
How would it help even if I told you?

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.820
You don't care about me anyway.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.380
Plus, I didn't tell Pei Heng about my injury.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:24.820
Does it hurt?

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.100
Yes.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.620
Good that you've applied medicine.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.020
Sleep well.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.460
Don't leave me alone here!

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.780
I'll ask Zi Rui to guard you.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.900
I want you to stay with me!

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.700
Why didn't you ask me

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.540
whether I like sleeping
in bed or on the floor?

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.980
Cause I like sleeping in bed.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.860
The floor is too hard.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.820
It's good for your waist.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.260
Are you asleep?

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.220
The moon tonight

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.820
is as round as the first time when you stayed

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.980
in my room.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.700
I'm sorry

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.420
that I lied to you.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.500
I know you must be sad.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.860
It'd be good if you are also lying right now.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.380
Mr. Pei, it's a gift from Her Highness!

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.700
Playing music

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.260
is useless!

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.420
I can't even protect the person I love!

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.140
You have no control of any soldier.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.100
You can't even protect yourself,

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.780
let alone the person you love!

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.340
Mother!

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.580
Flower token!

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.900

Finally your Young Master

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.060
got back together with our Crown Princess!

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.900
Of course!

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.540
Look, how gentle our Young Master is!

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.380
When I finish the business here in Huayuan,

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.380
I'll take you back to Xuanhu City.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.380
Then could you please stop

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.860
forcing my mother

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.500
and drop the plan of conquering Huayuan City?

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.540
No!

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.500
But, I've agreed

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.900
to go back to Xuanhu with you!

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.220
I won't fall

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.460
for your honey trap again.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.740
I'll send someone from Xuanhu
to take over Huayuan.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.100
You can just go back to Xuanhu with me

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.100
and be my wife.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.100
Huayuan is an inheritance from my ancestors.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.940
My mother exerts her utmost effort
into the city.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.540
How can you ask someone
from Xuanhu to take over it?

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.620
She's old now.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.260
It's time for her to abdicate.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.220
Then what about Chuchu?

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.580
You were able to come back this time

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.220
because Chuchu saved your life!

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.260
Are you going to fight against her, too?

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.980
Even without the Second Princess,

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.740
I'd still be able to get away.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.780
She saved me

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.300
because she was going to use me.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.700
After your mother

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.660
issued the abdication decree tomorrow,

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.060
they'll all become my prisoners.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.900
Chuchu truly loves you.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.580
But I only care about if you truly love me.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.620
You are so ruthless.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.180
How would I even dare love you?

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.820
Your nature will never change.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.420
What do you mean by "my nature"?

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.740
You, Han Shuo,

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.180
the Crown Prince of Xuanhu City,

00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.460
a meticulous man

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.020
who's vowed to conquer Huayuan City.

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.260
However, due to your heart disease,
you weren't supposed to live long.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.820
Yet you got the Dragon Bone from Huayuan
and cured your disease.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.580
You made yourself a hostage
of Huayuan to spy on us.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.260
You pretended to be sick
while having an evil plan going on.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.460
You are indeed a demon behind the scene.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.900
I wrote three pages about your biography.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.500
I know very well what kind of person you are!

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.100
If you are angry, just take it out on me.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.900
Why do you give others a hard time?

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.220
Moreover, my mother is old

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.060
and she just had a stroke!

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.500
So in your eyes,

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.420
I only appear to be loyal

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.820
but actually I am a wicked
petty man in disguise?

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.780
Since I came back,

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.740
have you ever asked me

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.540
how I have been during the exile?

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.460
Have I eaten or slept well?

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.980
Yet you care a great deal about your mother.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.820
I just locked her up for only a few days,

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.340
and you already see me as your enemy!

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.380
You are so good at distinguishing
the close from the distant.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.580
You are jealous of my mother?

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.260
Let me ask you.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.140
If your mother and I fell into water
at the same time,

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:58.900
who would you save first?

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.300
I can't believe you'd ask me
a fatal question like this!

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.900
Sounds like you'd save her first!

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.220
Hey, you are a man,

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.300
can't you swim?

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.700
Why would you fight with a woman?

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.780
Now you admit that I'm a man!

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.180
I thought men are known

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.740
as weak and humble in your Huayuan City.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.740
Since you are worried about your mother

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.700
and you are so filial,

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.060
she's seriously sick right now,

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.580
if you dare disobey me,

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.940
I will end her life early!

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.820
I'll go back to the City Owner's Mansion!

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:45.940
Guards!

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.140
Zi Rui!

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.460
Closely watch Her Highness!

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.500
No one is allowed to be in

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.820
or out!

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.300
Yes!

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:06.500
Let's go!

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.180
Look, what a sissy you are!

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.580
What are you anxious about?

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:18.740
Our Young Master

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.620
won't hurt your Crown Princess!

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.820
He was just bluffing.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.100
Couldn't you see that?

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.140
Who would expect that the Crown Princess

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.180
has quite a quick temper.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.380
You've gone too far!

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.180
They haven't even officially remarried yet,

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.100
your Young Master already started

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.220
thinking about seizing

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.540
Her Highness' property!

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.260
In that case,

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.380
Huayuan City will be
part of pre-marital property.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.860
The pre-marital property and marital property

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.420
are indivisible!

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.740
Who knows if your Young Master

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.940
will love another girl after marriage.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.860
If he did, Her Highness would lose
both her husband and money.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.620
But when our Young Master
was sent into exile,

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.020
he also lost everything.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:49.820
In my opinion,

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.780
your Huayuan City is much more scheming

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:52.980
and harder to guard against.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.660
I'm not leaving! I'll stay right here.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.500
I'll see what your Young Master

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.340
is going to do to our Crown Princess!

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.300
Suit yourself!

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.340
So? Have you heard anything?

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.500
After the Second Princess
took charge of the country affairs,

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.140
she used the flower token
to redeploy the City Guards,

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.020
but had no intention to save Her Majesty.

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.300
As you expected,

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.460
there's indeed different voice from the army.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.620
But the Second Princess suppressed it.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.660
If we can get the flower token

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.540
and ask the guards
to serve the Crown Princess,

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.100
Qianqian will be rescued!

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.980
But Mr. Pei, will they listen to you?

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.420
After all...

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.820
After all, I'm a man, right?

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.220
I don't dare!

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.300
Gender shouldn't get in the way
of one's future.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.980
I'm a man, so what?

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.460
The Minister of Defense has always
come from our Pei family.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.660
My mother was such a prestigious woman.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.740
And I'm her only successor.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.020
Mr. Pei, you are right!

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.380
You are a man, so what?

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.980
Have you taken care

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:19.940
of the thing I asked?

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.300
I've made the arrangement.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.060
But the flower token...

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.660
We'll just do our best,

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.980
and let fate sort out the rest.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:28.340
Yes.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.620
(Xingzi Mansion)

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.340
Mr. Pei, please follow me.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.700
Mr. Pei,

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.140
former Minister Pei once entrusted me

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.980
with taking care of
the Second Princess and you.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.860
Me?

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.820
I thought

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.660
my mother left the City Guards to Chuchu

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.220
because she didn't see me as important.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.020
You were her dearest son.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.460
To her,

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.860
you and the Second Princess

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.060
were both important.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.420
She was a righteous person and died on duty.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.820
I think she didn't want
to see the Second Princess

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.060
betray the City Owner.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.660
I'll lure the Second Princess

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.940
to check the flower token later,

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.220
and you can take it away from there.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:47.780
Mother has been sick for days.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.460
I'll ask her

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.140
to issue the abdication decree tomorrow,

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.820
in case there's any further trouble.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:53.740
No hurry.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.060
Everything is under our control.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.660
You don't need to worry too much.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.860
Are you hiding something from me?

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.580
You and I

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.260
are on the same boat now.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.700
Don't worry.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.660
I will help you become the City Owner.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.620
And about the black water mine
we talked about...

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.820
Since I promised, I will keep my word.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.060
Good!

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.380
Young Master,

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.140
I'm taking a lot of risks

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.940
working with you this time.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.580
But I'm different from Qianqian.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.460
My feelings to you...

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.500
Her Highness! Her Highness!

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.580
What is it?

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.660
The City Guards caught a theft,

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.740
who was trying to steal the flower token!

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.740
Steal the flower token?

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.100
Since you have something urgent came up,

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.820
I'll see myself out.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.300
You can leave. I'll be there soon.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.460
Yes.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.220
Mr. Pei,

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.740
this is the military camp.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.420
Trespassing on the military camp
is a capital offense!

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.140
I wouldn't be here in the middle of night

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.940
if it wasn't for an emergency!

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.940
Here is the flower token!

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.300
City Guards, listen up!

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.300
I order you to follow my lead.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.580
In the battle tomorrow
at the City Owner's Mansion,

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.460
you will surrender to the Crown Princess,
rescue Her Majesty,

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.620
and fight Han Shuo to the death!

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.660
Mr. Pei,

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.660
I thought you came here this late

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.260
for something important,

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.380
but it turns out you were here
to tell us a joke!

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.380
When have City Guards ever knelt to men?

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.980
As a man,

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.780
you want to lead the army?

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.740
How funny!

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.060
This is Huayuan City, not Xuanhu!

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.940
Men can never

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.260
call the shots!

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.580
Don't you think, everybody?

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.380
That's right!

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.380
It doesn't matter it's Xuanhu

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.660
or Huayuan.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.500
I have the flower token.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.260
Whatever I say should be
considered military command!

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.340
When my mother Pei Wujiang was alive,

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.020
she promised Her Majesty

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.380
that the City Guards
would defend her to the death.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.260
And now Her Majesty is in trouble,

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.620
yet you wanna break your promise?

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.020
The important positions of the City Guards

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.420
have never been assigned to men.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:48.660
You think

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.460
you can order us around
with a piece of token?

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.340
Guys, let's go!

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.860
The Minister of Defense
has always come from the Pei family.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.620
Although I'm a man,

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.300
my family name is Pei;

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.340
I also have the guts and courage
of the City Guards!

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.580
She deserved to die!

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.180
And who wanna die next?

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:26.940
Well...

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:29.980
Listen up, City Guards!

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.140
The City Owner and the Crown Princess
are in danger.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.740
Assemble all troops

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.020
and enter the city to rescue them!

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.140
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.620
What should I do?

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.140
Will I be locked up here by Han Shuo

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.580
till the ending?

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.460
But with mother's personality,

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.580
it's unlikely that she'll compromise
with Han Shuo and Chuchu.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.780
What if they had a conflict
and ended up fighting each other?

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.140
No, I have to sort it out.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.060
Xiaoqian, you've written so many major scenes

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.180
and you've experienced a lot,

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.260
but why would you chicken out
in front of swords?

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:57.500
Qianqian,

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.340
I'm here to save you!

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.500
You said

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.660
that I'd become

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.460
the first male Minister of Defense.

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.540
And I did it!

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.300
Sorry!

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.380
It's not your fault!

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.300
It's just I can't be who I used to be.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.660
I must get the power
