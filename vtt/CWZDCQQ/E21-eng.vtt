=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020
(Episode 21)

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.100
Mother,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.420
I've drafted the abdication decree.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.340
Now I only need the City Owner Seal.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.060
This is the most thoughtful thing

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.380
you've ever done so far.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.900
Thank you for your compliment!

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.940
Since you've forged the decree,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.300
why didn't you forge a City Owner Seal
at the same time?

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.180
It should be very easy to you.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.260
You know that these are all forgeable,

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.420
so this fake decree is obviously

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.780
not convincing enough.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.100
Why don't you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.500
just help me this one last time?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.380
Walk out of here

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.740
and announce in the meeting hall

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.260
that you'll pass your throne to me,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.380
and demote Chen Qianqian to a commoner.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.100
You told me

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.060
that you've been raising me
as your successor.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.100
"The City Owner of Huayuan

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.740
has ruled the city for 25 years.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.220
Though the city was once in turmoil,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.020
with the blessing of our great ancestors,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.340
it was revitalized again.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.660
After observing the astrological signs
and people's will,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.980
though people's support is there,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.500
The City Owner is in a bad shape

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.740
and no longer capable
to lead the future of Huayuan.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.620
The Third Princess Chen Qianqian

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.180
was appointed as the Crown Princess,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.220
yet she is ill-behaved
and has no sense of morality.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.740
She's not a good fit for the position,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.780
and she's not

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.620
as large-hearted and caring as
Chen Chuchu, the Second Princess.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.100
You are large-hearted and caring?

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.240
And she is ill-behaved
and has no sense of morality?

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.800
Do you know

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.280
that when you were born,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.440
Huayuan and Xuanhu were right at war.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.560
To rescue Huayuan City,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.640
Minister Pei sacrificed her life.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.400
At that moment, I made up my mind

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.340
to raise you into
a righteous person like her.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.080
Later on, you were really
more and more like her.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.940
If

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.340
you can inherit Huayuan

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.200
and become the next City Owner,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.220
I think you'd live up to your capabilities.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.740
Why did you

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.040
talk about late Minister Pei?

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.980
I...

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.560
I just remembered something from the past.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.400
I feel sorry that my years of effort

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.000
has gone in vain!

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.540
Mother, we don't have so much time!

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.020
Do you remember how the corner of this seal

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.700
was damaged?

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.860
When you were little,

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.380
you thought it was a toy
and tossed it around.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.380
Then you accidentally chipped the corner.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.260
But I didn't blame you at all.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.420
I didn't expect

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.460
that when you touched it again,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.020
you'd use it

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
to do such an unfilial and disloyal thing!

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.060
If I had known it,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.860
I should have punished you severely

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.980
and let you know the gravity of misbehavior!

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.460
At this point,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.140
it's too late to change my mind!

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.780
Your Majesty!

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.980
You... you dare to threaten me?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.460
Mother, just grant my request!

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.060
You!

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.140
Give it to me!

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.260
Chuchu!

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.700
Your Highness! Young Master Han betrayed us!

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.460
Our people

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.160
have been surrounded by Xuanhu army!

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.540
What?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.380
Han Shuo tricked me!

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.460
You idiot! You opened the door to our enemy?

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.580
Han Shuo is a crafty person!

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.900
You are not his match at all!

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.580
Only Qianqian can contain him!

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.660
Han Shuo!

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.860
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.820
Han Shuo, you promised you'd work with me,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.180
but you betrayed me
while I was negotiating with my mother!

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.340
It's only because you are too credulous,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.220
just like how I was before.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.060
Chen Qianqian was the one who lied to you!

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.060
My heart for you is real!

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.220
How can you treat me like this
because of her mistake?

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.740
You should blame
that you are all women of Huayuan.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.180
So you only have Chen Qianqian

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.660
in your heart?

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.620
Your Highness!

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.220
Stop!

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.660
Pei Heng, you stole the flower token?

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.780
Arrest Han Shuo, now!

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.500
The City Guards' job is to protect
Her Majesty and Huayuan City.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.740
We'll never disgrace the fame of Pei family!

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.780
Looks like between your mother and me,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.980
you chose your mother.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.100
Between Huayuan and me,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.940
you chose Huayuan.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.660
Han Shuo.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.060
My love for you

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.860
and my intention of
protecting Huayuan citizens

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.740
are not against each other.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.900
Do you understand?

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.820
Arrest them all!

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.140
Report!

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:33.940
Minister Pei!

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.460
A group of bandits helped us
take the city gate back!

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.820
Bandits?

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.660
Could it be Meng Guo?

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.420
Meng Guo!

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.180
How did we forget about him?!

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.220
Young Master, it'll be too late
if we don't go now.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.740
There's still one thing I need.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.460
When we conquer Huayuan,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.300
the Crown Princess will belong
to you sooner or later!

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.180
Qianqian, come with me!

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.140
Stop!

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.060
Mother!

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.800
Arrest Han Shuo and Chen Chuchu!

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.900
Mother!

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.500
Chuchu,

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.780
from now on, I'm no longer

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.000
your mother!

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.140
Maybe I owed you

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.540
in the beginning,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.020
but now, we are even!

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.400
Your Highness, did you receive my letter?

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.500
Han Shuo, Her Highness
asked me to follow you,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.260
but you escaped!

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.980
I'll capture you again today

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.380
to fulfill my mission
that Her Highness assigned to me!

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.780
Han Shuo,

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.740
please stop!

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.500
You mean

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.380
Han Shuo was the principal criminal,

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.980
and Chuchu was his hostage?

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.940
Chuchu has been a prudent
and sensible person.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.180
If she weren't threatened,

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.340
she wouldn't have rebelled.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.620
She tried to stab Qianqian

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.420
because she wanted to prevent
Han Shuo from escaping.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.500
You stole the flower token from Chuchu.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.020
Why are you trying to save her now?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.780
Even if I'm not,

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.100
I think you'll still forgive her

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.180
and spare her life.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.780
Rebellion is a serious sin!

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.700
Why do you assume that I'd let her go?

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.500
Because she's the only daughter
of the late Minister Pei!

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.820
Because you promised my mother

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.600
that you'd take good care of Chuchu!

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.940
How did you know that?

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.780
My mother died in battle.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.380
Chuchu was a baby and you pitied her,

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.980
so you adopted her.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.940
Back then, I was already old enough
to remember things.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.830
But now,

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.060
Chuchu made a big mistake.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.680
Let Han Shuo die for her.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.620
Once Han Shuo is dead,

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.510
no one else will know the truth.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.340
Chuchu could be an accomplice,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.590
could be a hostage,

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.720
could even be a heroine

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.430
who spied for days
and finally made her work worth.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.270
No matter what, let Han Shuo

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.680
take all the blame!

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.120
Good!

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.950
Like mother, like son!

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.420
You do live up to your mother's reputation!

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.240
Though I planned everything,

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.640
I forgot about Meng Guo's troop.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.870
I should have listened to Bai Ji

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.150
and enlisted Meng Guo into my army.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.320
You finally got what you wanted.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.020
I'm here to save you!

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.030
You think I can still be saved?

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.480
The daughter turned against her mother.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.440
The sisters fought each other
over the throne.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.770
In order to shut my mouth
and save her dignity,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.320
the City Owner will certainly kill me!

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.620
You'll live

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.100
if I want you to.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.040
You think I'll still trust you?

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.300
Han Shuo,

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.540
you still don't know

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.520
that my love for you is real, do you?

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.780
I regard myself as a smart person.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.460
But you always make me feel

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.940
that I'm just fooling myself.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.800
No matter what I want,

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.880
I'll end up doing things as you wish.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.560

Mother!

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.100
Could you please spare Han Shuo's life?

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.300
If you must kill him today,

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.060
I'll die together with him!

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.180
We are a real couple now!

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.820
I'm not lying!

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.980
I really love him!

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.880
I can let Chuchu be the Crown Princess.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.390
With your guide,

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.760
I'm sure she'll be a qualified City Owner!

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.780
And you can also be relieved.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.660
Mother,

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.540
just consider that I died on the day

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.780
I married to Han Shuo.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.480
I'm begging you!

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.300
Please spare his life!

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.660
I'm willing to give up everything

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.920
as long as you set him free.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.580
Then what about me?

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.940
You won't even want your mother anymore

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.660
because of this man?

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.260
Mother, are you happy being a City Owner?

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.820
I never wanted

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.380
to be the Crown Princess.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.940
I only want Han Shuo!

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.420
Then I really need to kill him!

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.360
Behead him!

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.220

can put an end

to this mess.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.540

Or you'll be sad.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.500
It's my fault!

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.460
I didn't know she loved you this much!

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.700
To save your life,

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.300
she even killed herself!

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.100
If I had known that,

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.460
I wouldn't have stolen the flower token

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.820
and led the City Guards to siege you.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.780
You had no choice.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.140
We represented two different sides.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.500
You only did that to rescue Qianqian.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.220
And I wouldn't have convinced Her Majesty

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.820
to let you take

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.060
all the blame.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.420
You asked the City Owner to kill me?

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.180
So that was for selfish reasons!

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.780
You thought you could

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.700
be with Qianqian after I died?

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.100
It's my fault

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.180
that Qianqian died!

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.900
That's right!

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.420
It is your fault!

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.060
Look!

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.900
She'd rather sacrifice her own life

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.020
than watch me die

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.820
and be with you!

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.020
Didn't you feel ashamed
to say something like that?

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.460
Qianqian killed herself,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.660
yet you don't feel sad at all!

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.380
Apparently you were just

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.220
fooling and using her!

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.460
I really regret that I didn't get a chance

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.660
to show Qianqian who you really were

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.380
and let you pay for what you did!

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.540
It is what it is.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.740
You and Qianqian weren't meant
to be together in this life.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:57.980
From now on,

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.100
just forget about her.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.460
I can't!

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.780
How can I forget her?

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.460
(Will always be remembered)

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.340
I let her wait for too long.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.700
We were engaged

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.820
when we were little.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.540
I should have married her later.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.780
But I was too young

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.740
and always stalled our marriage.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.500
That's why I missed her.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.500
You mean

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.820
if you had married her earlier,

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.300
I wouldn't have had any chance?

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.060
Men of Xuanhu are all cold-hearted!

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.540
If I had known things
would turn out like this,

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.900
I wouldn't have let you have her, ever!

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.900
You let me have her?

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.540
I fought for her myself!

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.380
My love for Qianqian is real!

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.460
But to you, it's worth nothing!

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.260
Real?

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.860
Are you willing to die for her?

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.380
Die for her?

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.300
You don't dare!

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.700
But I do!

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.420
It's my fault that Qianqian died!

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.580
I won't let her

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.100
die alone!

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.180
Don't!

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.940
Hold on a sec!

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.300
Calm down!

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.340
I'll accompany her!

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.620
I asked you to wait!

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:06.620
Wait!

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.740
Pei Heng!

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.700
Qianqian! Qianqian!

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:30.860
You are still alive?!

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.420
It... it was just a prop.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.020
I thought it could deceive everybody.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.140
You faked your death?

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.100
We said that we'd keep this a secret.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.380
How come you let it slip

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:50.980
in front of Pei Heng?

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.340
You've pushed him into a corner!

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.580
What were you up to?

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.380
Well, I just accidently

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.300
said something wrong!

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.940
Pei Heng, I'm sorry

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.980
that you had to go through that.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.780
I really had

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.100
no other choice.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.460
You did this for Han Shuo,

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.100
as well as to ease

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.580
Chuchu's mind.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.780
Are you going

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.540
to leave Huayuan City?

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.220
Han Shuo,

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.340
would you please give us a moment?

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.740
I have something to say to Pei Heng.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.340
I heard

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.580
what you said just now.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.980
If I had the courage
to tell you that earlier,

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.100
things for us might

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.940
be different.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:05.580
Pei Heng,

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.780
maybe we didn't belong to each other
from the very beginning.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.620
The me you love

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.620
isn't the one you knew

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.940
or the one you thought I was.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.620
Just pretend that I was poisoned to death

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.340
on my wedding night
when I drank the cross-cupped wine.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.100
You hated me back then.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.180
There's one less eyesore in this world,

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.940
and no one will force you anymore

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.580
to marry someone you don't like.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.180
Maybe thinking of it this way

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.180
will make you feel a little better.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.420
But you didn't die.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.260
Falling in love with you

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.340
after your marriage

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.340
is the best thing that has ever happened

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.340
to me so far.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.980
It felt like

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.020
my life became meaningful

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.020
from that moment on.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.020
You were the one who told me

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.620
that I could also have my aspiration,

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.380
I could do whatever I wanted to do

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.420
just like a woman.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.180
But later on, I realized

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.220
my aspiration,

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.980
the one I loved the most,

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.420
was you!

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.620
I didn't know what love was either,

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.780
until I met Han Shuo.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:51.620
Pei Heng,

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.540
you will meet a nice girl in the future.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.500
Don't be concerned about me.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.020
I will be fine.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:15.460
Alright.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.020
Starting tomorrow,

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.100
I won't love you anymore.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.140
And you don't need to worry about me either.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:34.860
Okay.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.700
It's a deal.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.460
(Yueli Mansion)

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.100
May you rest in peace, Your Highness!

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.820
What are you doing here?

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.780
Qianqian was my sister after all.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.260
I'm here to offer my condolences.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.500
She's already

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.100
gone.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.540
She won't fight with you for anything now.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.220
You are on your own!

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.740
Say, since Chen Qianqian is dead,

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.940
why isn't Pei Heng crying?

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.500
Zi Zhu,

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.380
go find some stuff for me.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.230
What were you talking about?

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:26.900
Nothing.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.340
Why do you wanna know?

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.260
I'm afraid

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.200
that Pei Heng is still in love with you.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.740
After you pass away,

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.140
I'll name you

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.460
"Xuanhu King of Jealousy"

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.180
as your posthumous name!

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:42.840
I think it'll work!

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.500
More people are coming!

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.140
Your Highness!

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.540
Her Majesty, the Princess Royal
and the Second Princess

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.700
have all arrived.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.740
Get ready!

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.220
Come on, cover me up!

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:57.700
Listen,

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.620
Chuchu is very smart.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.260
Don't let my mother find out the truth!

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.500
Come on! Hurry!

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.100
How come I think

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.260
you are still hiding something from me

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.460
aside from Pei Heng?

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:06.860
I need to know all of your secrets

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.420
so that I can feel relieved.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.380
Young Master, hurry up!

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.300
They are here!

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.780
Okay! Come on, close it up!

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.340
We've opened our hearts to each other.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.580
I'm not keeping anything from you!

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.540
Close it up, now!

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.300
When you lie,

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.300
you always look all over the place!

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.340
You haven't explained

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.220
about your Kung Fu.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.220
I will tell you after we
get to Xuanhu City, alright?

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:27.980
Just cover me up, now!

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.240
Come on! We don't have time!

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.300
Okay, then it's a deal!

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.060
If you lie to me again,

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.860
I'll let you know
who wears the pants in our family!

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.060
Don't close it fully! I need to breathe!

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.700
(In memorial of my beloved wife Chen Qianqian)

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.200
Qianqian!

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.800
Qianqian!

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.540
Qianqian!

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:15.420
Mother,

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.580
shall we take one last look at Qianqian?

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.700
Your Majesty,

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.460
you'd better not.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.060
It'll only make you sad.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:27.820
Mother.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.420
Mother. Qianqian is gone.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.500
You need to take good care of yourself.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.740
Forget it.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:41.980
Let's not look at her.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.720
Just let her rest in peace.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.520
Mother,

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.120
I have a method
that can protect her body from decay

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.340
and make her face remain the way it is.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.300
What method?

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.020
Refine mercury from cinnabar

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.540
and inject the mercury
into her blood vessels.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.180
This way, the body will never decay.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.460
She wants to poison me to death!

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.220
Qianqian was the Crown Princess of Huayuan!

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.140
How can you treat her body with disrespect?

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.940
No.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.500
Just let her rest.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:25.860
In that case,

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.020
I have a nice coffin in my mansion.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.220
It's well sealed,

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.780
insect-repelling and moisture-proof.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.540
It suits her noble status better.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.220
Put Qianqian

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.820
in that coffin later.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.460
That coffin is sealed tightly.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.140
I'll suffocate to death

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.420
even before Han Shuo digs me up!

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.540
Qianqian disobeyed Her Majesty;

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.260
she was a sinner.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.420
She doesn't deserve such a nice coffin.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.860
You may as well just save that for yourself!

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.220
Since she was a sinner,

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.180
then she can't be buried
in the tomb of our ancestors.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:55.580
But mother

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.500
certainly won't let Qianqian
wander in the wild

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.060
and become a homeless ghost.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.900
Why don't we cremate her body
instead of burying her?

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.100
That way, we can make her relics into sarira,

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.980
which will be enshrined
in the ancestral temple

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.460
to comfort her spirit in heaven.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.380
She wants to burn me into ashes!

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.340
She won't even give me a break after I died!

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.300
How come

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.700
you hate Qianqian this much?

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.740
Han Shuo, you are getting so upset.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.220
Are you afraid of anything?

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.460
Maybe

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.180
you did something to Qianqian?

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.380
Chen Chuchu!

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.300
She was your sister!

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:44.940
Chen Chuchu!

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:45.900
Stop it!

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.460
Air! I need air!

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.300
Qianqian!

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.420
Qianqian!

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.020
My daughter!

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.460
Qianqian!

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.300
I'll say goodbye to you now!

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.660
If your spirit can hear me,

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.420
please come visit me in my dreams!

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.220
I will offer sacrifices to you

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.260
on new moon and full moon days.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.900
Your two sisters

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.660
will remember you, too!

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.220
Your Majesty! Sorry for your loss!

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.620
Your Majesty, sorry for your loss!

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.500
Mother!

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:55.460
Mother!

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.540
Yuanyuan!

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.940
Yuanyuan!

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.260
Chuchu!

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.260
You two

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.660
are all I have now.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.420
Just let me

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.340
take care of Qianqian's funeral.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.660
You may take your leave now.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.740
Your Majesty.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.380
Life and death are all destined.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.380
Please

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.980
take care!

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.180
Han Shuo,

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.380
Qianqian is making

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.700
such a big sacrifice for you.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.620
You've got to treat her well!

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.540
Mother

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.100
just... just left like that?

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.120
She wouldn't even say
anything more to my body?

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.540
Is she still angry with me?

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.980
She wouldn't forgive me even I'm dead.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.380
She may already know your plan.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.860
What a childish play!

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.340
Your Majesty, you mean

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.780
the Third Princess faked her death?

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.060
If I hadn't played along,

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.220
her trick would've been exposed!

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.820
The Third Princess

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.540
is surely stubborn.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.260
She hurt you so badly

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.220
in order to save Han Shuo's life.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.580
Not only to save Han Shuo,

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.580
but also to save Huayuan City.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.940
From now on, Chuchu

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.060
will be my only successor.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.180
There'll be no more fights.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.700
Though the citizens
of Huayuan support Qianqian,

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.420
Chuchu can't stand her.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.420
If she didn't die,

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.580
Chuchu and I

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.660
would never get along.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.100
So the Crown Princess

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:08.940
actually gave up on the City Owner's position?

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.100
Today,

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.180
I admitted her death,

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.500
which means we are
no longer mother and daughter.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.740
She betrayed me that day

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.660
for Han Shuo on the execution ground.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.940
And today,

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.780
I betrayed her

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.740
for Huayuan in the mourning hall.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.300
I don't know if Qianqian will blame me.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.820
I think she will understand
your thoughtfulness.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.620
But

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.780
it'll be difficult for her
to return to Huayuan in the future.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.900
Don't know when

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.620
you can see each other again.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.780
Escort her to the cemetery tonight

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.380
and offer her a chance to leave.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.620
Yes!

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.940
Her Majesty has ordered

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.620
to bury the Third Princess
in the cemetery tonight.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.340
I'll let her fake death become true

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.540
and bury her there forever!

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.700
Yes! I will finish this mission.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.380
Then come back soon.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.620
I still need to find a way
to take back the flower token.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.580
In fact, if you are promoted
to be the Crown Princess,

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.100
it should be appropriate
to appoint Mr. Pei

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.460
as the Minister of Defense.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.740
What are you talking about?

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.380
How can a man be qualified to lead the army

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.580
and command the City Guards?

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.260
However, when I become the Crown Princess,

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.380
it'll be different.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.380
I will appoint you as the lieutenant!

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.740
I will do my best to serve you,
Your Highness!

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.100
Go ahead.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.140
Can you go faster?

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.540
I... I'm afraid!

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.300
It's a little scary in here!

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.420
If you are afraid,

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.420
I can get in and hold you in my arms.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.060
Don't!

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.980
It'd feel like you bury
yourself alive for me.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.820
Plus, the oxygen inside is
not enough for two people.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.020
What's oxygen?

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.940
It's a type of gas

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.380
on which humans live.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.420
Without it, people can't survive.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.460
Then you are my oxygen!

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:29.460
Let her go!

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.220
Su Ziying?

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.620
Chen Qianqian, you are really alive!

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.180
Yingying, please calm down!

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.340
Put... put the sword down.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.340
I know what you want.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.140
Just put the sword down.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.540
Let's talk, okay?

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.020
I want you to die!

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.620
Lin Qi!

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.940
Lin Qi! You are alive!

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.980
I haven't got my revenge yet.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:05.900
Of course, I couldn't die!

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.020
Did Chen Chuchu send you?

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.580
It doesn't matter who sent me.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.780
What matters is

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.140
that all of you should be dead!

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.540
Just kill me

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.260
if you dare!

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.380
Look, if you had surrendered to me earlier,

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.460
there wouldn't be so much trouble!

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.700
What do you wanna do to him?

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.260
Your Highness,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:24.860
you can also capture and release him
seven times respectively.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.500
He will definitely change his ways after that

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.660
and submit to you completely.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.300
Meng,

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.740
Su Ziying is different from you!

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.460
I can never catch him again if I release him.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.500
Then I'll be after him wherever he goes!

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.140
What do you want to do to him exactly?

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.740
Su Ziying tried to kill you several times!

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:41.820
He deserves to die!

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.580
Wait!

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.460
Don't... don't kill him!

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.260
Just tie him up.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.220
In case he makes trouble again.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.860
Now, please take your buddy away!

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.420
Thank you, Your Highness!

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.260
Let's go! Come on!

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.740
What brought you here?

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.500
I heard you were dead
and about to be buried here.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.140
So I came to burn incense for you.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.940
Who would expect something
like this would happen?

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.300
If I had known that, I would have come later.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.420
Maybe I could have really
offered you some incense.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:11.980
Can't believe I actually saved you!

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.620
Your bark is always worse than your bite.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.980
I know you wouldn't let me die.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.980
You know me so well!

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.540
My fake death plan failed now.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.740
It's even harder for me
to dodge Chuchu's attack in the future.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.140
Go to Xuanhu City with me.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.540
I'll take you to my home.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.980
From now on, you need not

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.260
worry about what will happen in Huayuan.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.700
Let's go to Xuanhu City together!

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:40.700
No way!

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:48.380
Who's that?

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.980
He's a traveling merchant from Xuanhu City.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.100
He saved my life when I was badly injured.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.460
We... We...

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:01.500
You are married?!

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.660
That's great! Let him come with us!

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:04.380
We can be each other's company on the way!

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:04.980
Call him over! Come on!

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.060
Who said I'd go with you?

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.900
I have a husband now!

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.620
