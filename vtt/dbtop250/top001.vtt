摩根·弗里曼

片名：《肖申克的救赎》

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.220
为何我会颤抖
Then why do I thrill?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.430
又是什么盘旋在我脑海
And what makes my head go round and round

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.310
而我初心仍在驻守
While my heart stands still?

威 廉 姆 · 赛 德 勒

都以你的名字开头结束
With just your name?

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.070
克  兰  西 · 布  朗

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.590
且我依然深信
And would I be sure

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.510
这份爱无与伦比
That this is love beyond compare?

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.220
这一切怎会成真
Would all this be true

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.730
如果我真不在乎
If I didn't care for you?

马 克 · 罗 斯 顿

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.580
我们吵得很凶
It was very bitter.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.250
她说不怕我知道  她讨厌偷偷摸摸
She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.280
她还说  想去雷诺市办离婚
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.280
雷诺市（Reno），美国有名的“离婚城市”，在内华达州的西部，

你怎样回答?
What was your response?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.300
我拒绝离婚
I told her I would not grant one.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.560
“你休想活着去雷诺市。”
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.100
邻居作证你说过这句话
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to your neighbors.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.800
也许吧
If they say so.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.830
我气炸了  记不清楚
I really don't remember. I was upset.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.410
布 莱 恩·利 比
尼 尔·君 图 力

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.540
你们吵完以后呢？
What happened after you argued with your wife?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.480
她收拾行李
She packed a bag.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.810
去跟……昆汀住
She packed a bag to go and stay with... Mr. Quentin.

戴 维·普 罗 瓦 尔
约 瑟 夫·拉 尼 奥

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.890
你最近才发现  他是你太太的情夫
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.560
你跟踪她吗？
Did you follow her?

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.330
我先去酒吧买醉
I went to a few bars first.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.270
保 罗·麦 克 拉 伦
胡 德·西 科 利 亚

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.400
然后去他家  但没人在
Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home,

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.030
我在避车道停了车
so I... parked in the turnout,

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.260
等他们
and waited.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.070
用意何在？
With what intention?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.110
我不确定
I'm not sure.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.740
我醉了
I was confused.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.170
詹 姆 斯·惠 特 摩
饰 布鲁克斯·海特伦

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.030
糊里糊涂
Drunk.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.090
我想……
I think...

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.140
最多只是吓吓他们
mostly, I wanted to scare them.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.720
结果他们一回来  你就冲进屋杀了他们
When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.080
不  我逐渐酒醒
No. I was sobering up.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.390
开车回家  睡觉解烦
I got back in the car, and I drove home to sleep it off.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.310
选角导演
黛  博·拉  亚  居  拉

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.070
途中把枪丢入皇家河
Along the way, I stopped, and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.260
我已讲得很清楚
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.570
但清洁妇隔天早晨上工时
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.370
发现床上的二人尸体
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.250
配 乐
托  马  斯·纽  曼

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.670
身上满是点三八的弹孔
riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.250
你不觉得这很巧吗？ 还是只有我这么想？
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.140
是很巧
Yes, it does.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.520
但你仍声称早在案发前
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun into the river...

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.350
服装设计
伊丽莎白·麦克布赖德

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.840
就已丢弃了枪
before the murders took place?

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.220
这种说法倒是很省事
That's very convenient.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.090
这是实话
It's the truth.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.030
警方打捞三天都没找到
The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.610
这样就无法比对你的手枪和
So, there could be no comparison made between your gun and the bullets...

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.660
艺  术  指  导
特 伦 斯 · 马  什

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.030
从受害人血尸内取出的弹头
taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.050
所以呢
And that also...

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.460
这样也非常省事
is very convenient.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.050
不是吗  杜弗伦先生
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.350
我是清白的
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.190
所以找不到枪  反倒对我非常不利
I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.330
剪  辑
理查德·弗朗西斯·布鲁斯

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.440
一切证据各位都已明了
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.480
案发时被告在场
We have the accused at the scene of the crime.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.480
脚印、胎痕都是明证
We have footprints, tire tracks,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.550
散落地面的子弹上有他的指纹
bullets strewn on the ground which bear his fingerprints,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.720
酒瓶碎片上同样也有指痕
a broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.400
摄  影  指  导
罗  杰 · 狄  金  斯

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.480
最重要的是
And most of all,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.750
一位美女与情夫
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover...

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.990
相拥而死
lying dead in each other's arms.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.790
他们是有伤风化
They had sinned.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.010
监  制  人

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.010
利兹 · 格洛策
大卫 · 莱斯特

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.530
但是
But was their crime so great...

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.000
罪该致死吗？
as to merit a death sentence?

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.510
与此同时  请各位
Now, while you think about that...

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.740
再考虑一件事
think about this:

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.000
一只左轮手枪只能装六发子弹  而非八发
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.620
《丽塔·海沃斯与肖申克的救赎》

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:45.700
改编自史蒂芬·金所著短篇小说

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.250
所以他并非一时冲动
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.250
冲动即使不可宽恕  但尚可理解
That at least could be understood, if not condoned.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.480
然而
No.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.850
这是复仇
This was revenge...

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.470
残忍而冷血的谋杀  想想看
of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.070
这两人各中四枪
Four bullets per victim.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.530
共八枪  而非六枪
Not six shots fired, but eight.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.630
因此他是先射完一轮
That means that he fired the gun empty,

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.230
编     剧
弗 兰 克·达 拉 邦 特

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.010
再装弹补上两枪
and then stopped to reload so that he could shoot each of them again.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.710
一人添一枪
An extra bullet per lover.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.810
正中脑袋
Right in the head.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.120
你面目冷漠  全无悔意  杜弗伦先生
You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.660
看见你就令我齿冷
It chills my blood just to look at you.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.550
制 作 人
尼  基·马  文

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.330

By the power vested in me by the state of Maine,

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.830
我判处你两次终身监禁
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences, back-to-back.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.730
分别为两位死者偿命  退庭！
One for each of your victims. So be it!

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.040
导 演
弗 兰 克 · 达 拉 邦 特

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.030
坐下
Sit.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.410
根据你的材料  你的终身监禁已经服满20年
We see, by your file, you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.240
是的
Yes, sir.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.540
你改过自新了吗？
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.540
是的  完全改造好了
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.680
我是说  我已吸取教训
I mean, I learned my lesson.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.190
真的  我已洗心革面
I can honestly say... I'm a changed man.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.790
我不会再做危害社会的事了
I'm no longer a danger to society.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.970
我向上帝发誓
That's God's honest truth.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.890
驳    回

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.570
瑞德
Hey, Red.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.070
怎样？
How'd it go?

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.430
一样的狗屎  不一天吃
Same old shit, different day.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.570
了解
Yeah, I know how you feel.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.770
我下周也准备要吃闭门羹
I'm up for rejection next week.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.070
我上周才假释被拒
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.580
很正常
It happens.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.220
嗨  瑞德  借一包烟吧
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.720
滚开  你欠我五包了
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man? You've had five packs already.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.910
-四包  -五包
-Four!  -Five!

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.490
美国每个监狱里可能都会有我这样的人
There must be a con like me in every prison in America.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.490
我能为你弄到各种东西
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.790
香烟啦  大麻啦
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer - if that's your thing...

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.440
孩子高中毕业想喝白兰地也行
... - a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high-school graduation.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.760
只要你想  几乎都没问题
Damn near anything, within reason.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.700
是的 先生  我就像百货公司
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.700
西尔斯与罗巴克公司（Sears and Roebuck），美国著名大百货公司，
1886年由理查德·W.西尔斯和阿尔瓦·罗巴克创办于芝加哥。

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.580
所以1949年当安迪·杜弗伦来找我
So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949...

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.340
问能否弄张丽塔·海华丝的海报进来时
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him,

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.820
我二话不说  “没问题！”
I told him, "No problem."

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.870
到大门口集合
To the main gate.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:30.380
《肖申克的救赎》主要在俄亥俄州的曼斯菲尔拍摄，片中监狱的场景大多在废弃的俄亥俄州立感化院拍摄。
该感化院也曾为多部影片取景，但是大多的院内广场已被改建，不过哥特式管理建筑物至今仍矗立在那，
并且托电影的福，成为了观光景点。

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.380
到大门口集合
To the main gate.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.860
安迪在47年初进肖申克监狱
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.970
罪名是杀害老婆和情夫
in early 1947, for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.360
他原本是缅因州波特兰市一家大银行的副总裁
On the outside he had been vice-president of a large Portland bank.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.360
缅因州波特兰市，位于缅因湾岸，是美国缅因州最大的城市，
历史上曾经历四次大火，故其格言为“Resurgam”（拉丁语，意为“我将再起”），
原著作者斯蒂芬·金就生于长于此城，他小说中的故事绝大部分发生在缅因州，
俄勒冈州的波特兰市即取名自此城。

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.600
年轻有为  前程远大
Good work for a man as young as he was.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.470
这边  瑞德
Hey, Red.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.620
听得懂英语吗？
Do you speak English, butt steak?

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.690
跟这位长官走
You follow this officer.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.700
我这辈子没见过这么多满脸晦气的窝囊废
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.530
菜鸟  过来
Hey, fish! Come over here!

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.870
快点  菜鸟
Come on, fish.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.200
打个赌吧  瑞德？
Taking bets today, Red?

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.260
赌烟还是赌钱？
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.160
烟  我赌两根
Smokes. Put me down for two.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.260
你买哪个？
All right. Who's your horse?

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.240
那个小个子
That little sack of shit,

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.720
前面排第八
eighth from the front.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.980
他会是头名
He'll be first.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.110
算你眼瞎  我赌了
- Bullshit. I'll take that action. - Me too.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.510
你输定了
You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.480
你聪明  你挑呀
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.780
胖脸肥臀那个
I'll take...t-t-the chubby fat-ass there.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.580
从头数第五个  我赌五根烟
The fifth one from the front. Put me down for a quarter deck.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.620
头名菜鸟来咯
Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.490
头名菜鸟大选日
Fresh fish today!

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.750
我们又有的玩啦
We're reeling them in!

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.060
说实话  当初我并不看好他
I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy, first time I laid eyes on him.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.500
弱不禁风
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.970
这是他给我的最初印象
That was my first impression of the man.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.610
你挑谁  瑞德？
What do you say, Red?

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:15.110
面带富贵相的高个儿
That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.440
他？ 不可能啦
That guy? Never happen.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.680
我赌十根烟
Ten cigarettes.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.910
有种
That's a rich bet.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.180
谁要和我赌？
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.180
赫伍？ 渣哥？
Heywood? Jigger?

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.790
史基？
Skeet?

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.320
福洛？
Floyd!

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.320
你们输定了
Four brave souls.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.290
回牢房准备点名
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.800
全都回牢房
All prisoners return to your cell blocks.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.310
向右转
Turn to the right!

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.820
向前看
Eyes front.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.500
他是看守长海利
This is Mr. Hadley. He's Captain of the Guards.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.800
我是典狱长诺顿
I'm Mr. Norton, the Warden.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.200
你们被判有罪
You are convicted felons.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.500
所以被送到这来
That's why they've sent you to me.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.480
第一条规矩
Rule number one:

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.170
不许亵渎上帝
No blasphemy.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.120
这里不准滥呼上帝之名
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.520
其它规矩……
The other rules...

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.020
你们慢慢就知道了  有问题吗？
you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.450
什么时候吃饭？
When do we eat?

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.160
我们叫你吃就吃
You eat when we say you eat!

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.640
叫你拉就拉  叫你撒就撒
You shit when we say you shit, and you piss when we say you piss.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.680
听明白了吗？人渣
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.030
啊
Aarghh!

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:56.910
站起来
On your feet.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.880
我只相信两件事
I believe in two things:

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.570
纪律和圣经
discipline and the Bible.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.110
你们两样都少不了
Here you'll receive both.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.050
把信仰寄托神
Put your trust in the Lord.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.890
把贱命交给我
Your ass belongs to me.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.630
肖申克监狱欢迎各位
Welcome to Shawshank.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.170
解铐
Unhook 'em.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.980
转身
Turn around.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.250
可以了
That's enough.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.150
到笼子边上去
Move to the end of the cage.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.450
转身
Turn around.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.280
洒除虱粉
Delouse him.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.090
转身
Turn around.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.630
出来左转  去领囚衣和圣经
Move out of the cage, go left. Pick up your clothes and Bible.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.170
下一个
Next man up!

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.910
向右
To the right.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.170
右转  右转
Right, right, right.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.970
向左
Left, left...

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.180
头一夜最难熬  绝对如此
The first night's the toughest. No doubt about it.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.740
光着屁股行进  像刚出生时那样
They march you in, naked as the day you were born,

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.750
火辣的药粉令你半盲
skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.820
等进了囚笼……
And when they put you in that cell,

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.360
门闸锁上……
and those bars slam home...

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.020
你才明白这是玩真的
that's when you know it's for real.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.630
眨眼间  过去的一切都被刮走了
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.230
只留下无穷的悔恨
Nothing left, but all the time in the world to think about it.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.710
新来的初到之夜多半崩溃
Most new fish come close to madness the first night.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.980
总会有人哭出来
Somebody always breaks down crying.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.140
毫无例外
Happens every time.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.850
唯一的问题是
The only question is:

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.810
谁会是第一个
Who's it gonna be?

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.160
用这聚赌也挺有趣的
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.890
我赌安迪·杜弗伦
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.560
熄灯
Lights out!

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.420
我还记得我来这的第一晚
I remember my first night.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.200
那是很久很久以前的事了
Seems like a long time ago.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.770
吆吼
Yoo-hoo!

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.030
菜鸟  来嘛
Hey, fish.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.870
菜鸟  菜鸟
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.100
怕黑吗？
Boy, are you scared of the dark?

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.290
喜欢这儿吗？
You like it here, new fish?

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.900
后悔爸妈搞你出来？
You'll wish your daddy never dicked your mommy.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.990
小猪猪  你的肉好香
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.820
记下来了吗  菜鸟？ 过会要测验哦！
You taking this down, new fish? There's gonna be a quiz later!

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.580
屁股撅出来  让我头一个瞧
Poke your ass out, give me a first look!

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.580
嘘  小声点
Shh! Keep it down.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.460
老鸟总是捉弄菜鸟
The boys always go fishing with first-timers.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.730
直到惹哭才罢休
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.730
猪公
Hey, Fat Ass.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.570
肥臀
Fat Ass!

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.470
说句话嘛
Talk to me, boy.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.880
我知道你就在那儿  我听得到你喘气
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.050
听我的  别理这帮蠢货
Don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me?

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.150
这儿没那么糟啦
This place ain't so bad.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.810
跟你讲
I tell you what.

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.180
我会帮你引见  带你过家家
I'll introduce you around. Make you feel right at home.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.750
我知道有些个同志
I know a couple of big old bull queers...

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.930
会乐意亲近你
that would just Iove to make your acquaintance.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.620
尤其你那白肉肥臀
Especially that big, white, m-mushy butt of yours.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:35.920
天哪
God!

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.000
我不要坐牢
I don't belong here!

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.340
有人中奖了
We have a winner!

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.040
我要回家
I wanna go home!

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.800
肥臀中得头名
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.050
肥臀！ 肥臀！
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.480
头名菜鸟！ 头名菜鸟！
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.840
我不属于这里
I don't belong here!

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.450
我要回家
I want to go home!

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.650
我要见我妈妈
I want my mommy!

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.020
我搞过你妈  不够爽
I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.450
天杀的  你们在搞什么鬼？
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.760
你亵渎上帝  我要报告典狱长
He took the Lord's name in vain. I'm telling the Warden.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.400
你菊花插上警棍再去告我吧！
You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:13.460
放我出去！
Let me out of here!

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.010
发什么神经？ 猴胆好肥！
What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.200
求求你！ 我本不该在这里！
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:21.770
不该是我！
Not me!

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.310
我不想数到三  连一我都不去数
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.680
马上给我闭嘴  不然就给你来段“催眠曲”
Shut the fuck up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.050
快闭嘴  伙计
Shut up, man. Shut up!

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.930
你们弄错了
There's been a mistake!

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.180
你们不明白  我不该坐牢的
You don't understand.  I'm not supposed to be here.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.690
开门
Open that cell.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.160
我也不该在这里  这儿被你们搞得像座他妈的监狱！
Me neither! You people run this place like a fucking prison!

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.660
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.910
长官  别激动
Captain, take it easy!

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.570
今晚  再有谁敢哀嚎
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here the rest of the night,

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.210
我就扁得你们全部躺进医务室
I swear by God and sonny Jesus, you will all visit the infirmary.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.040
人人有份
Every last motherfucker in here.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.110
通知受托人  再把这废人抬去医务室
Call the trustees. Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.110
受托人，法律上也叫监管人，
指接受委托人（比如服刑人员）的委托，代理其从事诉讼、仲裁活动或财产监管的人。

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:53.100
安迪头一夜就害我输了两包烟
His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.300
他一声都没吭
He never made a sound.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.990
北三层  到齐
Tier 3 north, clear count!

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.720
南二层  到齐
Tier 2 north, clear count.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.590
南三层  到齐
Tier 3 south, clear.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.830
南一层  到齐
Tier 1 south, clear.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.630
南四层  到齐
Tier 4 south, clear.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.990
准备
Prepare to roll out.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.100
出发
Roll out!

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.190
你要吃吗？
Are... Are you going to eat that?

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.130
无此打算
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.430
能给我吗？
Do you mind?

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.670
又肥又嫩
Ah... that's nice and ripe.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.220
杰克说  谢谢你
Jake says thank you.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.890
它从车间的巢中掉出来
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.700
我要养到它会飞
I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.830
讨厌  他来了
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.410
早安  伙计们
Morning, fellas.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.580
真是个美好早晨啊
Fine morning, ain't it?

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.140
知道为何如此美好吗？
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.650
烟拿出来  就地排好
Come on. Set 'em down. I want 'em all lined up here,

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.480
像合唱队一样列齐
just like a pretty little chorus line.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:24.780
真壮观
Yeah, look at that!

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.490
-真受不了他  -我的乖乖
-I can't stand this guy.  -Look at that. Oh, Lord!

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.650
没错  正宗吉时香烟
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.650
赫伍口中的“Yes! Richmond, Virginia.”，说的就是吉时香烟（Chesterfield），
在世界上有很高知名度，很高人气，历史也悠久，
最初由德拉蒙德（DRUMMOND）烟草公司创立于1873年，迄今已近150年。

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.190
闻我的屁吧
Smell my ass!

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.390
闻完再闻我的
After he smells mine.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.530
瑞德  可惜你大大看走眼
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame about your horse coming in last, an' all.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.570
不过我真感谢我的猪公
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.770
出院后我得大大亲他一口
I owe that boy a big, sloppy kiss when I see him.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:50.180
请他抽烟才对  小人得志
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes, instead? Lucky fuck!

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.010
嘿  泰瑞
Hey, Tyrell.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.340
这周你在医务室值班吗？
You pull infirmary duty this week?

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.880
那肥仔怎样了？
How's that horse of mine doing?

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.410
挂了
Dead.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.450
海利打爆了他的头
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.850
医生回家睡觉了
The doc had gone home for the night.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.630
他一直僵到天亮
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.320
根本无法救治
By then, hell, there weren't nothing we could do.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.900
他叫什么名字？
What was his name?

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.540
你说什么？
What did you say?

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.850
我只是想问  有人知道他的名字吗
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.280
关你屁事  菜鸟
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.420
死人还关心什么名字
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was. He's dead.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
嘿
Hey...

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.470
有人上过你了吗？
Anybody come at you yet?

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.450
你名草有主了吗？
Anybody get to you yet?

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.650
牢里人人需要朋友
Hey, we all need friends in here.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.620
我可以当你朋友
I could be a friend to you.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.350
嘿
Hey...

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.230
不易上手
Hard to get.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.830
正合我意
I like that.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.010
起初安迪不与人来往
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.320
大概心事重重
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.590
努力适应牢狱生活
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.520
直到一个月后
It wasn't until a month went by that he opened his mouth...

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.090
他才主动找人攀谈
to say more than two words to somebody.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.850
那个人……
As it turned out...

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.200
就是我
that somebody was me.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.740
我叫安迪·杜弗伦
I'm Andy Dufresne.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.710
杀妻的银行家
The wife-killing banker.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:06.280
为了什么？
Why'd you do it?

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.780
实言相告  我没犯罪
I didn't, since you ask.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.220
你来对地方了
You're going to fit right in!

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.120
这里人人都无罪
Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.950
-赫伍  你为何入狱？  -我无罪  被律师害了
-Heywood, what are you in here for?  -Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.560
听说你颇爱耍酷
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.360
难道你的屁比别人香？
You think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.060
你说呢？
What do you think?

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.470
说老实话  我还不清楚
To tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.410
我知道你很有办法
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.680
我能够让你有求必应
I'm known to locate certain things, from time to time.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.680
我想要一把石锤
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.910
什么？
A What?

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.450
石锤
A rock hammer.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.490
-用来干什么？  -何必问呢？
-What is it, and why?  -What do you care?

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.560
若是牙刷  我就直接报价
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I'd just quote a price,

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.200
因为牙刷不危险  对吗？
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.170
也有道理
Fair enough.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.230
石锤大约六、七英寸长
A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.770
-像鹤嘴锄  -鹤嘴锄？
-Looks like a miniature pickax.  -Pickax?

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.170
-敲石头用的 -敲石头？
- For rocks. - Rocks.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.010
石英？
Quartz?

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.840
石英
Quartz.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.550
云母  页岩……
And some mica. Shale.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.920
石灰石
limestone.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.280
所以呢？
So?

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.060
我曾是石痴
So I'm a rock hound.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.590
我想重拾往日嗜好
At least, I was in my old life. I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.990
我看你是想捶人家脑袋
Or maybe you want to hammer somebody's skull.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.030
不是的  这儿没人犯着我
No, sir. I have no enemies here.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.600
没有？  且慢
No? Wait a while.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.770
话已传开了
Word gets around.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.930
三姐妹对你有性趣
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.110
尤其是伯格斯
Especially Bogs.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.550
就算跟他们说我不是同性恋也没用吗
I don't suppose it would help any if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.190
他们也不是
Neither are they.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.850
同性恋是人  但他们是畜牲
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.770
想干就干  根本不在乎你
Bull queers take by force. It's all they want or understand.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:07.490
我若是你  便会加倍提防
If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.470
-多谢忠告  -反正不用钱
-Thanks for the advice.  -Well, that's free.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:12.780
你明白我的顾虑吧
You understand my concern.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.570
我不用石锤惹事  行吗？
Well, if there's any trouble, I won't use the hammer.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.540
那你想逃狱  挖隧道？
Then I guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.110
有什么好笑？
Did I miss something? What's funny?

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.220
你看到它就明白了
You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.290
它市价多少？
What's an item like this usually go for?

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.990
奇石店卖七美元
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.990
我通常加两成
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.530
不过特殊东西嘛
But this is a specialty item.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.810
风险越大  价钱越高
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.200
一口价  十美元吧
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:44.740
就这样
Ten it is.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.500
其实你是白花钱
Waste of money, if you ask me.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.080
为什么？
Why's that?

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.510
狱方喜欢突击检查
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.090
发现石锤一定没收
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.380
到时候别把我供出来
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.820
否则再也别想跟我做生意
Mention my name, we never do business again.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.420
连口香糖都不卖给你  明白了吗
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now, you got that?

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.820
我懂的
I understand.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.130
谢谢  你叫……
Thank you, Mr. er...?

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.360
瑞德
Red.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.890
叫我瑞德
Name's Red.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.300
瑞德
Red?

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.470
为何叫瑞德？
Why do they call you that?

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.240
也许因为我是爱尔兰人吧
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.240
在小说里，瑞德是一个爱尔兰裔美国人，而在电影中瑞德是黑人；
爱尔兰人是白人，多红头发且好酒，
在安迪问到他为什么叫瑞德的时候，他开玩笑说“也许因为我是爱尔兰人”；
另外，Red也是救赎一词Redemption的前三个字母。

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.290
怪不得有人认为他臭屁
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.590
他闷声不响
He had a quiet way about him.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:43.090
步伐和谈吐简直异类
A walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.920
就像……
He strolled...

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.300
在公园散步  无忧无虑
like a man in the park, without a care or a worry in the world.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:54.170
仿佛身披隐形衣
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.770
没错
Yeah.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.340
我打一开始
I think it would be fair to say...

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.850
就喜欢他
I liked Andy from the start.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.180
别磨蹭  屁股后还有一大堆事呢
Let's go! Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.020
快点  快点
Move it! Come on. Move it!

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.660
鲍勃  最近怎样？ 你老婆待你还好吗？
Bob, how are you doing? How's the wife treating you?

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.180
继续走
Keep it moving.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.480
继续走
Just go.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.250
瑞德
Red.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.200
安迪说的对
Andy was right.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.640
见到货我就明白了
I finally got the joke.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.340
用它挖隧道
It would take a man about 600 years...

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.040
得挖六百年
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.220
-要书吗？  -不要
-Book? -Not today.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.250
-要书吗？  -不要
-Book? -No.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.690
老布
Hey, Brooksy.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.760
给杜弗伦的货
Delivery for Dufresne.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.940
要书吗？
Book?

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.070
要书吗？
Book?

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.050
杜弗伦
Dufresne...

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.110
你的书
Here's your book.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.290
谢谢
Thanks.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:03.320
杜弗伦  漂白粉不够了  你去后面拿点
We're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.140
这东西会弄瞎你的眼
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.910
宝贝  嘘
Honey, hush.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.430
反抗
That's it. You fight!

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.120
才刺激
It's better that way.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.430
我也希望会是另一种结局
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.630
就是安迪打赢  全身而退
and the Sisters let him be.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.040
我希望如此
I wish I could tell you that.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.220
然而监狱不是童话世界
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.320
他从没说过是谁干的
He never said who did it.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.150
但谁都明白
But we all knew.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.480
日子就这样一天天过去
Things went on like that for a while.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.390
监狱生活就像例行公事
Prison life consists of routine...

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.630
除此之外还是例行公事
and then more routine.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.660
安迪常常挂上新伤
Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.970
三姐妹不放过他
The Sisters kept at him.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.270
他有时打赢
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.970
有时吃败仗
Sometimes not.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.310
这就是安迪的监狱生活
And that's how it went for Andy.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.650
这就是他的例行公事
That was his routine.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:00.920
我相信最初那两年是他最糟糕的
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.790
我也相信日子再这样下去
And I also believe, if things had gone on that way,

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.560
这地方早晚会把他毁了
this place would have got the best of him.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.130
但是  在1949年的春天
But then, in the spring of 1949,

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.230
上头决定
the powers that be decided...

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.770
车牌厂的屋顶需要翻修
The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.170
我需要12名自愿者劳作一周
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.370
你们都知道
As you know,

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.640
特别的公差享有特别的待遇
special detail carries with it special privileges.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.250
这是户外公差
It was outdoor detail...

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:33.920
而五月是户外活动的好时间
and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.490
排好队
Stay in line there.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.860
一百多人志愿报名
More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.130
昂格
Wallace E. Unger.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.000
瑞丁
Ellis Redding.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:50.760
这不是很巧吗？
Wouldn't you know it?

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:54.510
我的哥们全都中签
Me and some fellows I know were among the names.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.700
安迪·杜弗伦
Andrew Dufresne.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:00.050
其实是每人一包烟买的
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:03.040
我照常抽两成
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.680
德州一个律师打电话来
So, this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from Texas.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.450
我问  “什么事？”
I say, "Yeah?"

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:12.350
他说  “抱歉，令兄过世。”
He says, "Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died."

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.460
-我很遗憾  -我才不为那烂人遗憾
-Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that. -I'm not. He was an asshole.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.860
他离家多年  早就当他死了
Ran off years ago. Figured him for dead, anyway.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.370
这位大律师说
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:25.800
“令兄是位富翁。”  挖油井赚了将近一百万
"Your brother died a rich man." Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.240
一百万？
A million bucks?

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:33.040
-对  算他走狗运  -有你一份吗?
-Fucking incredible how lucky some assholes get. -Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.410
他留给我三万五
35,000. That's what he left me.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.380
-美金？  -对
- Dollars? - Yeah.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.550
简直像中乐透嘛
Holy shit! That's great. That's like winning the sweepstakes.

00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:42.980
不是吗？
Isn't it?

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.160
政府是白混的吗？
Dumb shit. What do you think the government's gonna do to me?

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.730
它想大口分掉这大饼
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.830
可怜虫
Poor Byron.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.900
过路财神  真够倒霉
Terrible fucking luck, huh? Crying shame.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.370
有人就是命衰
Some people really got it awful.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.010
安迪  你疯了？
Andy, are you nuts?

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.110
专心干活！
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.280
缴了税还剩不少
Well, you'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up...

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.280
没错  够换新车
Oh, yeah, yeah. Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.650
但买车要缴税
I got to pay tax on the car.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:13.620
还要修理  保养  孩子吵着要兜风
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids pestering me to take them for a ride...

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.520
万一报错税  全得自付
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.850
告诉你  这就是山姆大叔
I tell you... Uncle Sam!

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.090
石头都榨得出血来
He puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:26.370
-安迪！ -他要干吗
- Andy! Andy! - What's he doing?

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.900
-他在找死  -继续干活
-Getting himself killed. -Keep tarring.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.660
什么哥哥  狗屁！
Some brother! Shit.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:32.860
嘿！
Hey!

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:38.010
海利先生
Mr. Hadley...

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.250
你信任老婆吗？
do you trust your wife?

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.380
真好笑
Oh, that's funny.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.480
你没了牙给我吹喇叭更好笑
You'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.060
她会扯你后腿吗？
I mean, do you think she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.560
够了  让开点  摩特
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:54.560
他活得不耐烦了
This fucker's having himself an accident.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.820
他要推落安迪
He'll push him off.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.900
她要是靠得住
Cos if you do trust her, there's no reason...

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:59.230
你就能领三万五
you can't keep that 35,000.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.230
-你说什么？ -三万五
-What did you say?  -35,000.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.130
-三万五？ -全部领到
- 35,000? - All of it.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.900
-全部？ -一个子儿也不少
- All of it? -Every penny.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.900
你最好别耍我
You'd better start making sense.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.440
想领全额  就赠与太太
If you want to keep the money, give it to your wife.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:14.550
国税局允许一生一次  最多六万的赠与免税
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $60,000.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.120
-狗屁  免税？  -对
-Bullshit. Tax-free?  -Tax-free.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.290
国税局征不到一文钱
The IRS can't touch one cent.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.180
你是那个杀妻的银行家？
You're that smart banker who killed his wife, aren't you?

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:25.760
信你难道不会害我跟你一块坐牢？
Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So I can end up in here with you?

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.800
完全合法  你去问国税局也一样
It's perfectly legal, go ask the IRS, they'll say the same thing.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
我不该开口的  我以为你会去问
I actually feel stupid telling you this, I'm sure you would've investigated the matter yourself.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.930
我不用你教我这些鸟事
Yeah, fucking A'! I don't need a smart wife-killing banker to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat!

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.540
没错  但你要找人填表
Of course not, but you do need someone to set up the tax-free gift for you,

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.300
请律师可得花钱
and that'll cost you. A lawyer for example.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.780
没卵的讼棍
Bunch of ball-washing bastards!

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:48.710
我帮你办  给你省钱
Right. I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.980
你领表我来填
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.950
完全免费
Nearly free of charge.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:57.490
只要请我同事一人三瓶啤酒
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.390
“同事”？ 够新鲜的
Ha! "Co-workers"! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.360
做黑手的有酒喝
I think a man working outdoors feels more like a man...

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.020
才有尊严  这是我的浅见
if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion...

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:08.460
长官
sir.

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:14.340
看什么看  干你们的
What are you jimmies staring at? Back to work!

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.140
干活
Let's go! Work!

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.590
于是呢
And that's how it came to pass...

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.450
在完工前一天
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.220
49年春的公差犯人
the convict crew that tarred the plate-factory in the spring of '49...

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.560
早上十点坐成排
wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning,

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:44.230
喝着冰镇啤酒
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer, courtesy of the hardest screw...

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:47.710
肖申克监狱历来最狠的狱官请的客
that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.350
娘儿们  趁凉快喝
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:56.010
这王八蛋还装大方呢
The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:01.610
阳光洒肩头  仿佛自由人
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders, and felt like free men.

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.430
像在修缮自家屋顶
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.460
像是造物主般自在
We were the lords of all creation.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.620
安迪呢……
As for Andy,

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:13.500
他窝在凉荫下
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.190
脸上挂着奇异微笑
a strange little smile on his face,

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.630
看着我们喝他的酒
watching us drink his beer.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.110
来一瓶吧？
Hey... Want a cold one, Andy?

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.720
谢谢  我戒酒了
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.750
你可以说  他想拍狱方马屁
You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.260
或是想博取狱友交情
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.060
但我呢？
Me,

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:48.070
我认为他只想重温自由
I think he did it just to feel normal again.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.740
哪怕只有一刹那
If only for a short while.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.470
将军
King me.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.970
-下棋  是帝王游戏  -什么？
-Chess. Now, there's a game of kings. -What?

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.910
讲文明  重谋略
Civilized. Strategic.

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.580
神秘得要死  真讨厌
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:06.620
改天我教你吧
Let me teach you someday.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.150
好
Sure.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.360
我想买个棋盘
I thought of getting a board together.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:14.650
你找对人了  我不论什么都弄得到
You're talking to the right man. I'm the guy that can get things, right?

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.860
棋盘用买的  但棋子我来刻
We might do business on a board, and I want to carve the pieces myself.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:22.370
一半用雪花石膏  一半用皂石
One side in alabaster, the opposing side in soapstone. What do you think?

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:24.370
要刻上许多年
I think it'll take years.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:27.100
时间有的是  就是缺石头
Well, years I got. What I don't have are the rocks.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.280
操场很贫瘠
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.310
多半是石子
Pebbles, mostly.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.450
咱们算是朋友吧？
Andy, we're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we?

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.880
算是吧
Yeah, I guess.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.050
能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you something?

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:45.960
你为什么杀人？
Why'd you do it?

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.760
我是清白的  瑞德
I'm innocent, Red.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.990
跟大家一样
Just like everybody else here.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.900
你呢？
What are you in for?

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:01.770
跟你一样  杀人
Murder. Same as you.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.140
清白的？
Innocent?

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:08.250
我是肖申克唯一有罪的
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.080
歌女呢？

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.580
你怎么知道？

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.080
-我知道什么？
-原来你不知道

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.440
来

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:19.050
歌女在这里

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.060
没想到她来寒舍献唱吧

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:29.960
的确……

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.560
没想到

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.100
瑞德
Red...

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.270
等一下
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:40.300
她要上场了
Here she comes.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.440
我最迷她甩头发的骚样
This is the part I really like - when she does that shit with her hair.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.380
这个月看过三场了
Oh, yeah, I know. I've seen it three times this month.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.480
姬旦  你衣着整齐吗？

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:50.610
在说我？

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.090
我爱死这段了
Hah! God, I love it.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.260
听说阁下有求必应
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:08.000
在下确非浪得虚名  你要什么？
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. What do you want?

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.330
-丽塔·海华丝  -什么？
-Rita Hayworth. -What?

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:12.270
弄得到吗？
Can you get her?

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.040
这位就是约翰尼·法雷尔啊  久仰大名

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.580
-要几个星期  -几星期？
-Take a few weeks. -Weeks?

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:25.190
我又没把她压在下面  抱歉这么说
Yeah, I don't have her stuffed down the front of my pants right now, sorry to say.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.000
沉住气哦  法雷尔先生

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.280
反正弄得到
But I'll get her.

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:28.620
放心
Relax.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:31.790
谢了
Thanks.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.120
这位就是  你该见过他

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.060
说了我来做什么吗？

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.890
没  我要给他个惊喜

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.150
-出去走走  -我得放映
-Take a walk! -I got to change reels!

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.380
我叫你滚
I said fuck off!

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:03.890
你不尖叫吗？
Ain't you going to scream?

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.090
咱们算算总帐
Let's get this over with.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.190
他打破我鼻子
He broke my fucking nose!

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:24.740
现在
Now...

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.380
我要解拉链
I'm going to open my fly...

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:30.410
叫你含什么你就含
and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:34.150
先舔我  再舔公鸡  因为你害他流鼻血
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.  You broke his nose.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.480
他应该得到偿还
I think ye ought to have something to show for it.

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.560
它进我的嘴  就跟你分家
Anything you put it in my mouth, you'll lose it.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.360
不  你没搞懂
No, you don't understand.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.720
我会用钻子刺穿你耳朵
You do that, and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:48.390
那你知道吗  脑部遇袭
All right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury...

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.540
会使人死劲咬
causes the victim to bite down hard.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.230
用力之大
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong...

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.540
得用撬棍
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.080
才扳得开
with a crowbar.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.580
你怎么知道？
Where do you get this shit?

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.190
书上写的
I read it.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.420
你识字吗  豆腐脑？
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.020
亲爱的
Honey...

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.690
你不该损我
You shouldn't!

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:21.270
伯格斯没逼他吹喇叭
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.600
其他两个也不敢
And neither did his friends.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:27.870
他们把安迪打个半死
What they did do... is beat him within an inch of his life.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.040
在医务室里待了一个月

遵命  头儿
It's your world, boss.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.340
什么事？
What?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.520
-他想去哪儿？  -抓住脚
-Where's he going?  -Grab his ankles.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.610
不要！ 救命！
No! No! No! Help me...

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:33.610
啊！
Aaarghh!

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.870
此后  有两件事再也没发生过
Two things never happened again after that.

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.280
三姐妹再也没碰安迪
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.610
伯格斯再也无法走路
And Bogs never walked again.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:50.280
他被转送到低戒护的医院
They transferred him to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:53.260
我只知道他的余生
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days...

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.290
全靠吸管进食
drinking his food through a straw.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.400
我想热烈欢迎安迪出院
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.700
没问题
Sounds good to us.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.460
咱们欠他的酒
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.470
他喜欢下棋
The man likes to play chess.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.880
帮他找石头吧
Let's get him some rocks.

那不是皂石 也不是雪花石
Heywood, that isn't soapstone! And it ain't alabaster, either.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.360
你他妈是地质学家？
What are you, a fucking geologist?

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.290
他说的没错
He's right. It ain't.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.400
-那这是什么？  -马粪蛋
-Well, what the hell is it? -A horse apple.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:05.770
-胡说!  -没有  就是马粪
-Bullshit!  -No, horseshit.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:07.460
马粪化石
Petrified.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.930
天哪
Oh, Jesus Christ!

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:17.640
他妈的
Oh, damn!

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:22.180
错误难免  但众志成城
Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.380
在安迪出院前一周
And by the weekend he was due back,

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:28.280
石头多得够他刻一辈子

悬疑小说
Erle Stanley Gardners.

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:47.000
每晚搬上车兜一圈
Every evening, I load up the cart and make my round.

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.870
记下借书人名字
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.110
如此往复  简简单单
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:56.750
-有问题吗？  -你管图书馆多久了?
-Any questions?  -Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:01.980
1905年入狱  1912年入馆
Oh... I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:05.450
这么多年都没有助手？
And in all that time, have you ever had an assistant?

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:08.130
没有  根本用不着
No. No, not much to it, really.

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.130
那为何现在派我来？
Why me? Why now?

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:11.860
不知道
I don't know,

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:15.090
但有人作伴真好
but it'd be nice to have some company down here for a change.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.000
杜弗伦
Dufresne!

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:28.650
就是他
That's him. That's the one.

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:37.450
我是狄金斯
I'm Dekins.

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.490
我打算……
I was er...

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:44.030
为孩子弄个教育基金
thinking about maybe setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:46.430
噢
Oh...

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:49.730
我懂了
I see.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:52.680
那么
Well, erm...

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:57.480
咱们坐下谈吧
Why don't we have a seat and talk it over.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:03.640
老布  有纸笔吗？
Brooks, do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.290
谢谢
Thanks.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.020
那么
So...

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.530
狄金斯先生
Mr. Dekins...

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:24.460
然后安迪说
And then Andy says: "Mr. Dekins...

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:27.670
“你想让贵公子进哈佛还是耶鲁？”
do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?"

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.930
你少瞎扯
He didn't say that!

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.770
真的  老天为证
As God is my witness, he did!

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:33.780
他愣了一下
Dekins just blinked for a second.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.280
傻笑出来  后来真跟安迪握手了
Then he laughed himself silly. And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.820
-握你的鸟  -真的握手
-My ass!  -Shook his hand.

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.960
我乐得差点尿出来
Hell, I... I near soiled myself!

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:47.420
若给安迪弄一套西装领带
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie and a little jiggly hula gal on his desk,

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:50.220
他就成了“咨询先生”
and he would have been: "Mr. Dufresne, if you please?"

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:52.060
开始交新朋友了  安迪？
Making a few friends, Andy?

00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:55.030
也不算“朋友”
I wouldn't say "friends."

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:59.070
我是精通理财的囚徒
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.

00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:01.610
这种本事很受用
It's a wonderful pet to have.

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:03.610
起码不用干洗衣工
Got you out of the laundry, though.

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:06.050
还派得上更大用场
Well, it might do more than that.

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.980
比如扩建图书馆  买新书
How about expanding the library? Get some new books in there.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.780
还不如申请张台球桌
If you're gonna ask for something, ask for a pool table.

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:13.340
对
Right.

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.490
你想怎么弄？
How do you expect to do that?

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:19.660
我是说  “咨询先生”  你打算怎么弄到新书？
I mean, get new books in here, "Mr. Dufresne, if you please?"

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.190
找典狱长要钱
Ask the Warden for funds.

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:27.330
孩子  我经历了六任典狱长
Son, son, son... Six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned...

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.870
学到的互古不变的真理就是
one immutable, universal truth:

00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:31.500
给钱是不可能的
Not one of them born...

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:36.640
他们没一个生来有屁眼
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:40.410
-预算太少了  -我了解
-The budget's stretched thin, as it is.  -I see.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.050
我可以写信跟州议会要钱
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds from them.

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:48.350
监狱领到款只能做三种用途
As far as they're concerned, there's only three ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.990
筑高墙  加牢笼  添警卫
More walls, more bars, more guards.

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.860
我仍请您恩准  一周一信
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. A letter a week.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.790
-总会有结果  -难说哦
-They can't ignore me forever.  -Sure can.

00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:59.730
想写就写吧
But you write your letters, if it makes you happy.

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.630
我一定寄出  行吗？
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:07.100
安迪开始一周一信
So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:08.900
他说话算话
just like he said.

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.710
不过  就像诺顿说的
And, just like Norton said,

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.410
毫无回音
Andy got no answers.

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:30.500
次年  他替半数的警卫报税
The following April, Andy did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:34.100
再过一年  全都找他帮忙
The year after that, he did them all...

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.270
包括典狱长的
including the Warden's.

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:41.460
再过一年  狱际棒球赛
The year after that, they rescheduled the start of the intramural season...

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.110
改在与税季重叠
to coincide with tax season.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:50.140
各监狱的警卫都带税单找他
The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.680
狱方发枪给你
So, Moresby Prison...

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:54.150
但要你付钱
issued you your gun, but you had to pay for it.

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:56.080
连枪套也要我付
Damn right. The holster, too.

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.780
这笔钱可以扣除
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.990
没错  安迪就像开小作坊
Yes, sir. Andy was a regular cottage industry.

00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:07.190
税季繁忙时  还可请帮手
In fact, it got so busy at tax time... he was allowed a staff.

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:09.960
瑞德  请帮我拿一叠个人预估税单
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:14.970
每年此时我调离工厂  乐到心坎里
It got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:19.370
至于信  他仍继续寄
And still... he kept sending those letters.

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:27.180
瑞德  安迪  老布出事了
Red, Andy. It's Brooks.

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.810
守着门
Watch the door.

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.390
别冲动  老布
Please, Brooks.

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.460
-冷静点  -混帐  退后
-Just calm the fuck down. -Stay back!

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.720
-都退后  -怎么回事？
-Stay back, goddamn it!  -What the hell's going on?

00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:36.720
我哪知道
You tell me.

00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:39.290
上一秒好好的  突然亮刀子
One second he's fine. Then out comes the knife.

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.300
老布  有话好说
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:45.300
放屁  没啥可说  我要割断他喉咙
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it! I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:47.300
等一下  赫伍哪里不对？
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:49.170
错在他们
It's what they done!

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.940
我别无选择
I... I got no choice...

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:53.710
谁都知道你不会伤害他
You won't hurt Heywood. We all know that. Even Heywood knows that.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.410
-是吧赫伍？  -没错
-Right, Heywood?  -I... I know that, sure.

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:59.950
因为他是朋友  而你明理
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.990
-对不对？ -对极了
-That's right. Right, guys? -Yes.

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.780
老布  看着我  放下刀
So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:07.260
把刀放下
Put the knife down.

00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.660
老布
Brooks...

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.290
看在上帝的份上 你瞧他的脖子
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:14.370
看看  都流血了
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:16.760
只有闯祸……
It's the only...

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:19.000
才能留在牢里
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:21.640
怎么可能  别做傻事
Come on. This is crazy. You don't want to do this.

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.940
把刀放下
Put it... put it down.

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:31.910
好了
Come on.

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.210
放松点
Take it easy.

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:36.450
不会有事的
You'll be all right.

00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:39.120
他没事  我呢？
Him? Hell, what about me?

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:41.690
老疯狗差点割断我喉咙
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.800
你刮胡子不也刀刀见血
Shit, Heywood, you've had worse from shaving.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.090
你怎么惹毛他的？
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.530
哪有  我只是来道别
I do nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.800
你没听说？ 上面准他假释了
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:56.940
我实在搞不明白
I just don't understand what happened in there. That's all.

00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:59.940
crazy as a shithouse rat，
俚语，疯得像一只茅房里的耗子，
意指“真地疯了”，多见于美国西部口语。

00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:59.940
这老家伙简直疯了
The old man's as crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:02.050
赫伍  住口
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:04.980
-听说你吓得屁滚尿流  -滚你的
-I heard he had you shitting in your pants. -Fuck you!

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:06.450
别斗嘴了
Would you knock it off?

00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:08.860
老布没疯
Brooks ain't no bug.

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:10.380
他只是……
He is just...

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:14.460
体制化了
He's just institutionalized.

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:17.770
“体制化”？  什么鸟词儿
"Institutionalized", my ass.

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:21.960
他坐了50年的牢  赫伍  50年呀
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood. 50 years!

00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:23.900
成了井底之蛙
This is all he knows.

00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:26.400
他念过书
In here, he's an important man.

00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:27.700
在狱中有地位
He's an educated man.

00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:30.440
出狱就成了废人
Outside, he's nothing.

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:34.810
双手犯关节炎的囚徒
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:38.010
想向图书馆借书都会被拒
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:40.020
这样说你懂吗？
You know what I'm trying to say?

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:43.190
我才不懂你的满嘴屁话
Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.690
随你怎么想吧
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.700
监狱是怪地方
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

00:59:47.300 --> 01:00:06.510
体制，可理解为包括某种规则、习惯、意识的环境，甚至是周围人的眼光、期许和评价；
体制化，是指对这种环境的适应，达到“内化”的程度，从而形成一道惯以为常的无形围墙，
将自我禁锢其中，因此，体制化可归纳为“过度顺应”。

00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.960
起先你恨它
First you hate 'em.

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.700
然后习惯它
Then you get used to 'em.

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.630
更久后
Enough time passes...

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:03.300
你离不开它
you get so you depend on 'em.

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:06.510
这就叫“体制化”
That's "institutionalized".

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.010
狗屎
Shit.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.980
-我才不会呢  -是吗？
-I can never get like that. -Oh, yeah?

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:14.340
等你呆到老布那把年纪再说吧
Say that when you've been here as long as Brooks has.

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:16.150
说的太对了
Goddamn right.

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:20.660
他们把你送到这里来度日
They send you here for life.

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:23.660
等于拿走你一生的年华
That's exactly what they take.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.390
至少是一大部分
The part that counts, anyway.

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:37.950
杰克  我无法再照顾你
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:40.780
走吧  你自由了
You go on, now.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.510
自由了
You're free.

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:46.340
自由了
You're free.

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:03.740
再见
Bye.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.040
一切顺利  老布
Good luck, Brooksie.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.400
保重
Take care of yourself, Brooks.

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:46.500
“亲爱的牢友：”
Dear fellas,

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:50.980
“外头的变化快得难以置信。”
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.

01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:54.950
老头儿  嫌命长吗
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:59.680
“小时候我只见过一辆汽车，”
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:02.760
“如今满街都是，”
but now...they're everywhere.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.740
“整个世界忙成一团。”
The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.320
“上面安排我到”
The parole board got me into this halfway house...

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.290
“一个叫‘布鲁尔’的中途之家，”
called "The Brewer",

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:33.650
“并在超市”
and a job...

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.830
“当包装员。”
bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:40.800
“工作辛苦，我也卖力，”
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.370
“但双手一直犯疼。”
but my hands hurt most of the time.

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:45.640
叫他务必用双层袋
Make sure your man double-bags.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.870
上次差点撑破袋子
Last time, the bottom near came out.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.480
确定要用双层袋
Make sure you double-bag, like the lady says. understand?

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.050
是  一定
Yes, sir. I surely will.

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:56.780
“店长不怎么喜欢我。”
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:04.090
“工作之余我去公园喂鸟，”
Sometimes, after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:06.020
“盼望……”
I keep thinking...

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.590
“杰克来打个招呼，”
Jake might just show up and say hello.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.190
“但它没出现过。”
But he never does.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.270
“不管它在何处，我祝它过的好、有新朋友。”
And I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.610
“我夜间难以入眠，”
I have trouble sleeping at night.

01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:28.180
“做着从高处坠落的噩梦。”
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:30.680
“从梦中惊醒，”
I wake up, scared.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:35.120
“有时记不起身在何方。”
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:41.530
“也许我该持枪抢劫，好让他们送我回去。”
Maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way, so they'd send me home.

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:46.160
“我可以打死那个店长，当作额外奖励。”
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.830
“但我老得无法再胡闹了。”
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense any more.

01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:53.800
“我不喜欢这里，”
I don't like it here.

01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:56.900
“我厌倦成天担惊受怕。”
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.200
“于是，我决心”
I've decided...

01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:00.510
“不再逗留。”
not to stay.

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.990
“当局不会在乎我，”
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.690
“一个糟老头算什么。”
not for an old crook like me.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:19.860
老布来此一游

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.430
“当局不会在乎我，一个糟老头算什么。”
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:29.300
“还有，替我向赫伍道歉，”
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.840
“别记恨在心。你们的老布”
No hard feelings. Brooks."

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.290
他还不如老死在肖申克好
He should have died in here.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.220
瞧瞧你干的好事
What the fuck have you done?

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:54.090
一片混乱
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:03.370
-这些是什么？  -你说呢  全是寄给你的
-What's all this?  -You tell me, fuck-stick. They're all addressed to you.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.970
看下这个
Take it.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.010
“杜弗伦先生：”
"Dear Mr. Dufresne,

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:19.120
“鉴于你再三询问，”
In response to your repeated enquiries,

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.590
“本州特拨款给贵图书馆。”
the State has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project."

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.190
有两百元
This is $200.

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:30.090
“另外，主管单位”
"In addition, the Library District has generously responded...

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.160
“特地捐赠旧书及杂物，”
with a charitable donation of used books and sundries.

01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:37.500
“相信可满足阁下需要，就此了结，”
We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.

01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:39.500
“勿再来信。”
Please stop sending us letters."

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.400
典狱长回来前清理干净
I want all this cleared out before the Warden gets back.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.800
是
Yes, sir.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.240
干得好  安迪
Good for you, Andy.

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.350
哇！
Wow!

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.490
只写了六年
It only took six years.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.790
现在起我一周两封
From now on, I'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.330
你真够固执的  听队长的话
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough. You'd better get all this stuff out,

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.030
把东西清干净  我去解大便
like the Captain said. Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.730
别让我出来
When I come back,

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.670
再看到这些
this is all gone, right?

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:38.980
如何修理任一汽车的任一部分

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:38.980
加戈头漫画

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.820
安迪  什么声音？
Andy, do you hear that?

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.720
杜弗伦
Dufresne?

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:14.790
安迪  放我出去！
Andy, let me out!

01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:19.130
安迪！
Andy?

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:26.610
到现在我还搞不懂她们唱什么
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:31.840
这首曲子出自莫扎特的歌剧《费加罗的婚礼》第三幕，
女主角苏珊娜（Susanna）与伯爵夫人（la Contessa）的二重唱
《待到微风轻轻吹过（Che Soave Zeffiretto）》（又称《微风拂面》）；
剧中三等家仆费加罗要和女仆苏珊娜结婚，受到怀有不轨之心的伯爵重重阻挠，
于是两位女士设计写一封信，邀花心的伯爵傍晚到树林幽会，使其落入陷阱出丑；
歌词很短，很简单，几乎就是伯爵夫人念一句，苏珊娜复述一次，然后写在信上：
伯爵夫人：希望能够吹起柔柔的西风……  苏珊娜：西风……
伯爵夫人：今晚会有风吧……  苏珊娜：今晚……
伯爵夫人：在林中松树的下面……  苏珊娜：松树的下面……
伯爵夫人：这样写，下面应该就知道了吧！  苏珊娜：应该会知道吧！
伯爵夫人：微风轻吹的歌啊！

01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:29.140
其实我也不想弄懂
The truth is, I don't want to know.

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.840
此时无言胜有言
Some things are best left unsaid.

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:38.150
她们唱出
I like to think they were singing about something so beautiful,

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:43.590
这部歌剧为什么对肖申克众囚犯有那么大的触动呢？
在当时的奥地利，仆人没有任何地位，
按当时的规矩，仆人结婚，新娘的初夜权是主人的，
社会上废除农奴制的呼声，开始出现；
这部歌剧的作曲水平很高，情感通过音乐完美传达给观众，
因此，公演后在维也纳激起强烈反响，民众同情费加罗的遭遇，更加支持废除农奴制，
很快，全欧掀起革命，莫扎特的理想实现了——他通过他的作品，为社会进步贡献了力量。
“即使我的舌头尝到了死亡的味道，我的音乐依然是乐观的。”——莫扎特

01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:40.480
难以言传的美
it can't be expressed in words...

01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:43.590
美得令你心碎
and makes your heart ache because of it.

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.750
歌声直窜云端
I tell you, those voices soared...

01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:52.330
超越失意囚徒的梦想
higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.

01:09:52.530 --> 01:09:55.900
宛如小鸟飞入牢房
It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage...

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.870
使石墙消失无踪
and made those walls dissolve away.

01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:01.500
就在这一瞬间
And for the briefest of moments...

01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:04.700
肖申克众囚仿佛重获自由
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.940
典狱长可发飚了
It pissed the Warden off something awful.

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.240
开门
Open the door.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.920
开门
Open it up!

01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:20.960
杜弗伦  开门
Dufresne, open this door!

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.490
关掉
Turn that off!

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:33.010
我警告你  关掉
I am warning you, Dufresne. Turn that off!

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.090
杜弗伦
Dufresne!

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.280
敬酒不吃吃罚酒
You're mine now.

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:02.970
安迪被关禁闭两周
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.

01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:04.760
站起来
On your feet.

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.340
-看谁来了  -大指挥家
-Hey, look who's here.  -Maestro!

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.340
大师（ Maestro）是意大利语，通常为技艺高超的音乐家的统称，
但时常也可用以称呼其他艺术门类里的艺术家，
可以指称：乐器演奏家、作曲家、指挥家以及教师。

01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:13.770
你没别的可放吗？  比如汉克·威廉斯的歌？
Y-Y-You couldn't play something good, huh? Hank Williams or something?

01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:13.770
汉克·威廉斯（Hank Williams），一生仅仅活了29年的美国乡村音乐歌手，
他的歌曲中，除了浓厚的乡村风味，很多带有蓝调的成份，
有歌迷将他比做文学界的莎士比亚，因为不知怎么那么悲伤和凄凉，
但其实他的妻子对他无微不至，即使他们后来离婚，她都爱他到最终；
他是西部歌曲之王，美国乡村西部歌曲存在这么多年，还没有一个歌手可以说自己超越汉克·威廉斯。

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.910
没等接受点歌  他们就破门而入了
They broke the door down before I could take requests.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.250
-关两周值得吗？  -我最舒服的两周
-Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?  -Easiest time I ever did.

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:24.650
-屁话  小号最难熬了  -在里面度日如年
-Bullshit! There's no such thing as easy time in the hole. -A week in the hole is like a year.

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:28.160
-半点不假  -有莫扎特陪我
-Damn straight.  -I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.330
他们准你带留声机？
So, they let you tote that record player down there, huh?

01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:35.130
在脑中
It was in here.

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:37.200
在心底
And in here.

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.430
音乐之美
That's the beauty of music.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.970
是夺不走的
They can't get that from you.

01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:48.880
你没体会过吗？
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:53.810
我年轻时吹过口琴
Well, I played a mean harmonica, as a younger man.

01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:56.550
后来没兴致了
Lost interest in it, though.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.350
在牢里也没意义
Didn't make much sense in here.

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.680
就是在这里才有意义
Here's where it makes the most sense.

01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:03.290
有音乐才不会忘记
You need it, so you don't forget.

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:05.060
忘记什么？
Forget?

01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:08.530
世上
Forget that...

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.170
有些地方
there are places...

01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:14.510
是石墙围不住的
in the world that aren't made out of stone.

01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:17.000
在人的
There's something...

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:18.740
内心深处
inside...

01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:20.980
有他们找不到
that they can't get to...

01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:22.550
拿不走的东西
that they can't touch.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.520
完全属于你自己的东西
It's yours.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.650
你指什么？
What are you talking about?

01:12:28.690 --> 01:12:29.920
希望
Hope.

01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:32.320
希望
Hope?

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.250
朋友  我告诉你
Let me tell you something, my friend.

01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:39.360
有希望才危险
Hope is a dangerous thing.

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:42.870
希望能把人逼疯
Hope can drive a man insane.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.730
在这里  希望毫无用处
It's got no use on the inside.

01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:48.140
你最好认命
You'd better get used to that idea.

01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:52.140
要像老布一样吗？
Like Brooks did?

01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:18.490
坐下
Sit down.

01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:27.140
根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满30年
It says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.380
你改过自新了吗？
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:31.810
是的
Oh, yes, sir.

01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:34.420
我真的已经变好了
Without a doubt.

01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:37.990
我完全洗心革面了
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:41.930
我不会再危害社会
No danger to society here.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.990
我向上帝发誓
God's honest truth.

01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:48.660
我绝对改过自新了
Absolutely rehabilitated.

30年了
Thirty years.

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.920
老天  真不知该说什么？
Jesus, when they say it like that...

01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:06.580
这些日子怎么熬过来的
You wonder where it went.

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.180
我连前十年都不记得了
I wonder where 10 years went.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.190
拿去
Here.

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:20.360
假释被拒的礼物

别介意我找你同行买
I had to go through one of your competitors.

01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:29.800

I hope you don't mind. I wanted it to be a surprise.

01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:41.340
漂亮极了
It's very pretty, Andy.

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.250
谢谢
Thank you.

01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:48.320
你不吹吗？
Are you going to play it?

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:54.130
不
No.

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.140
不是时候
Not right now.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:17.920
进牢
Roll in!

01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:36.160

01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:41.400
59年  州议会终于明白
In 1959, the State Senate finally clued into the fact...

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.770
两百元无法打发安迪
they couldn't buy him off with just a $200 check.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:49.280
当局决定每年拨款五百美元
Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500...

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.380
好让安迪封笔
just to shut him up.

01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:54.580
你想像不到他的能耐
And you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.

01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:57.720
他接洽读书会  慈善团体
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

01:16:57.930 --> 01:17:00.690
他论斤买入旧书

01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:24.450
基督山  饭桶
That's "Cristo", you dumb shit.

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:26.540

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:28.280
大种马

01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:29.650
种马？
Dumb ass.

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.020
种马？
Dumb ass?

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:37.900
大仲马  内容知道吗？
Dumas. You know what that's about?

01:17:40.170 --> 01:17:42.140
讲逃狱  你会喜欢的
You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.240
那该归入教育类啰
We ought to file that under "Educational", too, oughtn't we?

01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:51.200
大伙儿尽可能地帮忙
The rest of us did our best to pitch in when and where we could.

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:53.540
在肯尼迪遇刺那年
By the year Kennedy was shot,

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:56.600
布鲁克斯·海特伦图书纪念馆

01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:58.280
安迪把这间臭储藏室变成

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:01.680
新英格兰最棒的监狱图书馆
into the best prison library in New England,

01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:05.330
甚至有汉克·威廉斯精选集
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.630
就在同年
That was also the year Warden Norton...

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.770
典狱长实施著名的“外役”专案
instituted his famous "Inside Out" program.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.300
也许你曾在报上看过
You may remember reading about it.

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.640
他上了各报和《展望杂志》
It made all the papers and got his picture in Look Magazine.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.140
这不是放任自由
It's no free ride...

01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:28.580
而是狱政的
but rather a genuine, progressive advance...

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.270
一大进步
in corrections and rehabilitation.

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:34.140
本监服刑人在妥善监督下
Our inmates, properly supervised,

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.980

从事各项公共事业
performing all manner of public service.

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:43.260
他们将学到诚实劳动的价值
These men can learn the value...

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:47.260
同时为社区提供服务
of an honest day's labor, while providing a valuable service to the community...

01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:52.170
对于纳税大众而言  也只花最少的代价
and at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:54.940
当然  诺顿没向媒体说明
Of course, Norton failed to mention to the press...

01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.600
“最少代价”实在含糊不清
that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term.

01:18:58.810 --> 01:19:01.840
揩油的方法何止百种
There are 100 different ways to skim off the top.

01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:04.540
人力  物料  处处漏洞
Men, materials, you name it.

01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:07.790
天哪  油水超多
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:10.510
-这样下去  你会害我倒闭的  -内德
-If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business. -Ned!

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:15.200
-靠这么多奴工  谁投标投得过你  -内德
-This pool of slave labor you've got, you can underbid any contractor in town. -Ned,

01:19:15.730 --> 01:19:18.700
我们在提供社区服务
we're providing a valuable community service here.

01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:23.300
这是说词  我得养家
Well, that's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.760
山姆  咱们这么久的交情
Sam, we go back a long way.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.010
我需要包下这条公路  不然只好喝西北风了
I need this new highway contract. I don't get it, and I go under. That's a fact.

01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:35.710
这是我太太特地为你烤的派
You just have some of this fine pie...

01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:39.280
请笑纳
my missus made especially for you, and you think about that.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:50.260
别担心这项工程合约
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.560
我已叫他们接别的项目了
It seems to me I already got my boys committed elsewhere.

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.600
帮我谢谢她的心意
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:01.870
在每一桩买卖背后
And behind every shady deal,

01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:04.840
在每一个黑钱底下
behind every dollar earned,

01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:08.170
都有安迪在  是他做的帐
there was Andy, keeping the books.

01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:09.840
有两笔要存入银行
Two deposits.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:14.210
照旧在夜间  存到缅因国际和新英格兰
Maine National and New England First. Night drops as always, sir.

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:48.750
-把东西拿去洗衣房  两套西装和杂物  -是
-Get my stuff down to the laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot. -Yes, sir.

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:52.750
-别又浆太硬  否则有他们好看  -是
-Tell them if they over-starch my shirts again, they'll hear about it from me. -Yes, sir.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.290
我怎样？
How do I look?

01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:58.020
-很好  -要去参加盛大的慈善宴会
-Very nice, sir. -Big charity to-do up Portland way.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.550
州长会到
The Governor's going to be there.

01:21:00.970 --> 01:21:02.460
剩下的给你
Want the rest of this?

01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:05.710
烤得难吃透顶
The woman can't bake worth shit.

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:08.270
谢谢您
Thank you, sir.

01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:14.440
-我听说这种派他收过很多  -你听说的只是皮毛
-He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear. -What you hear isn't half of it.

01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:19.380
他干的坏事你根本想不到  重重的回扣
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:21.950
黑钱如河般在他脚下流
There's a river of dirty money running through this place.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:25.990
贪污这么多迟早会曝光
But the problem with having all that money is you'll have to explain where it came from.

01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:27.960
因此才要用我
That's where I come in.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.860
我过滤黑钱  一一漂白
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:33.900
股票  证券  市政公债
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:37.760
我让脏钱流入市场  等它回流时……
I send that money out into the real world, and when it comes back...

01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:40.940
-干净得像处女？  -比那更干净
-Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?  -Cleaner.

01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:45.140
诺顿退休时  将是百万富翁
By the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:51.820
若被逮到  他也会被关入肖申克
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna wind up in here wearing a number himself.

01:21:52.090 --> 01:21:54.780
你对我这么没信心啊
Now, Red, I thought you had a little more faith in me than that.

01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:58.020
我知道你很能干  但总会有蛛丝马迹留下
I know you're good, Andy, but all that paper leaves a trail.

01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:01.630
万一调查局或国税局起疑
Now, anybody gets curious, the FBI, the IRS,

01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:02.820
随便哪个要查
whatever,

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:04.560
总有人要遭殃
it's gonna lead to somebody.

01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:08.630
没错  但不是我  更不是典狱长
Sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the Warden.

01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:14.000
那是谁？
All right, who?

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:15.800
兰道·史帝文
Randall Stevens.

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.270
谁？
Who?

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.470
隐名又隐形的合伙人
The "silent" silent partner.

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.740
法官  要怪怪他  户头是他的
He's the guilty one, Your Honor, the man with the bank accounts.

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:25.110
他是洗钱的起点
That's where the filtering process starts.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.190
出了差错  只追得到他
If they trace anything, it's just going to lead to him.

01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:30.020
但他是什么人？
But who is he?

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:34.180
他是幻影  幽灵  兔子哈维的远房表亲
He's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.460
他由我一手
I conjured him...

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.030
凭空塑造
out of thin air.

01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:41.560
他不存在  除了在文件上
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.000
哪有凭空造人的？
Andy, you can't just make a person up.

01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:50.300
利用制度的漏洞就行
Sure you can, if you know how the system works, where the cracks are.

01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:53.640
靠写信能办成太多的事
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:56.610
史帝文有出生证明
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.940
有驾照  社会保险编号
a driver's license, social security number.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.210
你在逗我吧？
You're shitting me?

01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:03.290
就算抓到蛛丝马迹
If they ever trace any of those accounts, they're going to wind up chasing...

01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:05.020
也等于捕风捉影
a figment of my imagination.

01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:07.920
真想不到
Well, I'll be damned!

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.990
我有称赞过你吧？
Did I say you were good?

01:23:11.370 --> 01:23:12.990
你简直是大艺术家
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

01:23:11.370 --> 01:23:12.990
伦勃朗（Rembrandt，1606—1669），荷兰画家，擅长运用明暗对比，
讲究构图的完美，尤善于表现人物的神情和性格特征。

01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:15.460
可笑的是
You know, the funny thing is,

01:23:15.670 --> 01:23:19.770
在外头  我刚正不阿
on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.

01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:22.510
进了牢  却大搞欺骗
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:32.680
你担心过吗？
Ever bother you?

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.180
我没干坏事  只是洗钱
I don't run the scams, Red, I just process the profits.

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:39.450
也许这是强词夺理
A fine line, maybe...

01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:42.090
但我建起图书馆
but I also built that library...

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:45.320
帮助囚友考取高中文凭
and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.

01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:47.760
典狱长凭什么放任不管？
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:50.160
为了使你
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

01:23:50.370 --> 01:23:51.860
乐于帮他洗钱
Money instead of sheets.

01:23:52.210 --> 01:23:54.800
我算是便宜卖给他
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.690
汤米·威廉斯在65年来到肖申克
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965...

01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:17.160
犯了“入室行窃”  判了两年
on a two-year stretch for B and E.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.730
就是强行侵入他人公宅
That's breaking and entering to you.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.230
他在商店后门偷彩电时被逮
The cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JCPenney.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.230
杰西潘尼（JCPenney），美国最大的连锁百货商店之一，
1902年成立，总部位于美国德州普兰诺，为全球500强企业之一。

01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:25.970
小朋克
Young punk.

01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:27.800
摇滚狂一个
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll.

01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:29.530
跩得够可爱
Cocky as hell.

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.140
快点  老家伙们  慢得跟糖浆一样
Hey, come on, old boys! Moving like molasses!

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.140
我看了难过
Making me look bad.

01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:36.150
人见人爱
We liked him immediately.

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:40.110
我退出门外  就这样抱着电视
So I'm backing out the door, right? And I got the TV like this.

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:44.050
它很大  害我看不见  忽然传来
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Suddenly, I hear this voice.

01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:46.660
“别动，举起手来！”
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:51.320
我站着没动  抱紧电视
Well, I just stand there, holding onto that TV. So, finally, the voice says,

01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:55.330
他又说  “你听到没有？”  我说  “听到，但我若松手，”
"Do you hear what I said, boy?" I say, "Yes, sir. I sure did.

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:58.990
“就要添一条毁坏财产罪。”
But if I drop this fucking thing, you got me on destruction of property, too."

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.780
你在凯希曼监狱蹲过？
Hey, you've done a stretch in Cashman, right?

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.240
那儿要好过得多
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.450
周末回家  活也轻松
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:13.710
不像这里
Not like here.

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:16.360
你哪里都蹲过嘛
Sounds like you done time all over New England.

01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:19.190
我13岁起以牢为家
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13.

01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:21.590
你叫得上名的监狱我都待过
You name the place, chances are I've been there.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.460
也许你该改行了
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.460
依我看
What I mean is,

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.240
你的贼功不灵光  该试试别的
you don't seem to be a good thief. Maybe you should try something else.

01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:34.700
你懂个屁  你是卡彭？
Yeah, well, what the hell do you know about it, Capone?

01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:34.700
艾尔·卡彭（Al Capone），绰号疤面（Scarface），是一名美国黑帮成员，
他在禁酒时期获得名气，成为芝加哥犯罪集团联合创始人和老大。

01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:36.700
你为啥入狱？
What are you in for?

01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:37.970
我？
Me?

01:25:40.410 --> 01:25:42.080
被律师害了
The lawyer fucked me.

01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:48.960
肖申克没人有罪  你不知道？
Everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?

01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:01.270
汤米有娇妻和刚出生的女儿
As it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.960
他怕妻女流落街头
Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets...

01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:06.660
到头来不认识她爸
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

01:26:06.970 --> 01:26:08.340
或是别的什么原因
Whatever it was,

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.110
反正这小子卯上了
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:17.820
我想考高中文凭
I was thinking of maybe trying for my high school equivalency.

01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:20.540
听说你帮过人
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:24.120
我不帮废柴
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

01:26:25.530 --> 01:26:28.020
我才不是废柴
I ain't no goddamn loser.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.590
-你当真？  -对
-You mean that?  -Yeah.

01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:34.700
真的当真？
You really mean that?

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.100
真的
Yes, sir, I do.

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.270
好  要冲就冲到底
Good. Because if we do this,

01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:43.430
百分之百努力  不可半途而废
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.470
问题是……
The thing is, see...

01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:48.270
我不太识字
I don't read so good.

01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:50.540
好吧
Well.

01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:54.280
你不太识字……
You don't read...

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.050
没关系
so well.

01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:59.880
交给我吧
We'll get to that.

01:27:04.330 --> 01:27:06.460
安迪收汤米为徒
So, Andy took Tommy under his wing.

01:27:06.670 --> 01:27:09.300
从字母教起
He started walking him through his ABCs.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.630
汤米学得非常好
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:16.670
他从未发现自己有天份
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:22.450
没多久就开始准备考试
Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.

01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:24.310
安迪真心喜欢他
He really liked the kid.

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:28.080
助人向上令他兴奋
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.

01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:30.850
但动机不止于此
But that wasn't the only reason.

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:33.750
牢狱生活漫长得很
Prison time is slow time.

01:27:34.230 --> 01:27:36.820
必须找事打发时间
So you do what you can to keep going.

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.220
有人集邮
Some fellas collect stamps.

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:42.120
有人盖火柴屋
Others build matchstick houses.

01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:45.370
安迪成立了图书馆
Andy built a library.

01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:47.810
如今他需要新事由
Now he needed a new project.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.170
那就是汤米
Tommy was it.

01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:54.800
这跟他长年刻石一样
It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.

01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:58.580
也跟他挂美女图一样
The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

01:27:59.490 --> 01:28:00.750
在牢里
In prison,

01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:04.750
没事也得找事做
a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:10.390
1966年  就在汤米应考之前
By 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:12.830
换上拉寇儿·薇芝了
it was lovely Raquel.

01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:30.370
时间到
Time.

01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:37.410
怎样？
Well?

01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:41.150
烂透了
Well, it's for shit.

01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:44.490
我他妈白费一整年
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time with this bullshit.

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.190
也许没那么糟
It's probably not as bad as you think.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.630
就没一道题做对  简直像看中文
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.570
分数出来再说
Let's see how the score comes out.

01:28:52.770 --> 01:28:55.740
我告诉你几分吧
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.040
两分投篮
Two points, right there!

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:00.800
这就是该死的成绩
There's your goddamn score!

01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:04.750
什么猫爬树  五五二十五
Goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25...

01:29:05.690 --> 01:29:07.310
去他妈的这鬼地方
Fuck this place!

01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:08.680
去他妈的
Fuck it!

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.100
真后悔
I feel bad.

01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:30.500
让他失望了
I let him down.

01:29:30.710 --> 01:29:32.440
胡说
Ah, that's crap, kid.

01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:33.980
他以你为荣
He's proud of you.

01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:37.180
多年的交情  我摸透他了
We've been friends a long time, so I know him as good as anybody.

01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.940
他是聪明人
A smart fellow, ain't he?

01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:42.280
绝顶聪明  曾是银行家
As smart as they come. He used to be a banker on the outside.

01:29:42.490 --> 01:29:44.720
他究竟为何入狱?
What's he in here for, anyway?

01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:46.010
谋杀
Murder.

01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:48.860
你少扯了
The hell you say!

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.330
看他外表是想不到
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:58.660
捉到老婆跟高尔夫球教练在床  两个全干掉了
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. He greased them both.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.670
怎么了？
What?

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:11.580
大约四年前
About four years ago,

01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:15.080
我在托马斯顿监狱  服刑2到3年
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:16.890
我偷了车
I stole a car.

01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.250
实在愚蠢
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:22.160
刑期还剩半年时
About six months left to go,

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:24.360
来了个新室友
I get a new cellmate in.

01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:26.690
厄摩·布拉奇
Elmo Blatch.

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.730
混蛋一个  大个子  神经质
Big, twitchy fucker.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:33.100
谁都怕碰上这种室友  明白我的意思吧
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?

01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:36.040
持械抢劫  服刑6到12年
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:38.570
他说他干过好几百票
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:43.720
想不到有那么神经的人  你放个响屁  他都能离地三尺
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was. You'd cut a loud fart, he'd jump three feet in the air.

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:49.410
他的嘴永远闭不上
Talked all the time, too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.

01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:51.250
他去过的地方
Places he'd been in,

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:54.620
犯过的罪行  玩过的女人
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:57.060
甚至杀过的人
Even people he'd killed.

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.100
他说杀人
People who "gave him shit".

01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.290
只是因为不爽
That's how he put it.

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:07.970
有一晚  就当玩笑
So... one night, like a joke,

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:12.570
我问他  “你杀过谁？”
I say to him, I say, "Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:13.900
他说——
So he says:

01:31:14.110 --> 01:31:18.070
我在俱乐部收盘子
I got me this job one time bussing tables at a country club.

01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:22.650
趁机观察阔人下手
So I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.750
我相中一人
So I pick out this guy,

01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:29.220
在晚上
go in one night...

01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:31.160
摸进他家
and do his place.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.930
他醒来
He wakes up.

01:31:34.670 --> 01:31:36.430
惹得我不爽
He gives me shit.

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.170
我就杀了他
So I killed him.

01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:43.770
和他身边那骚货
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:47.440
精彩的是
That's the best part.

01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:50.910
虽搞上这个高尔夫球教练
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:53.840
她却是个有夫之妇
But she's married to some other guy.

01:31:54.450 --> 01:31:57.010
她老公  一个大银行家
Some hotshot banker.

01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:00.950
成了替罪羊
And he's the one they pinned it on.

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:16.310
我从未听过如此惊人的故事
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:20.070
最惊人的是你居然受骗
What amazes me most is you were taken in by it.

01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:21.800
什么？
Sir?

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:23.210
是这样
Well...

01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:27.610
显然汤米对你颇有好感
it's obvious this fella Williams is impressed with you.

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:32.160
知道你很痛苦  自然想让你高兴
He hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:34.520
他还年轻  脑筋不太灵光
He's young, not terribly bright.

01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:38.500
根本不明白这反而会害苦了你
Not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he'd put you in.

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:40.460
他说的是实情
Sir, he's telling the truth.

01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:45.400
就算真有厄摩这人
Well, let's say, for the moment, this Blatch does exist.

01:32:45.670 --> 01:32:50.300
难道他会跪地哭诉  “是我杀的，我忏悔，”
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, "Yes, I did it! I confess!

01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:53.210
“顺便再给我加个无期徒刑吧。”
And by the way, add a life term to my sentence."

01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:56.210
只要有汤米的证词  我就可以要求重审
That doesn't matter. With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:58.910
但你得找到厄摩
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.050
他可能早就出狱了
The chances are he'd be released by now.

01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:05.850
可以查他住址或亲属  这可是机会
They'd have his last address, names of relatives. There's a chance, isn't there?

01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:09.920
你真是个木头
How can you be so obtuse?

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:11.850
什么？
What?

01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:14.860
你说我什么？
What did you call me?

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.760
你笨蛋  我说错了吗？
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:18.630
你别忘了身份
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:21.910
俱乐部有厄摩的考勤卡
The country club will have his old timecards,

01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:24.870
履历  税单
records, W-2s, with his name on them.

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:27.770
你爱幻想  那是你的事
If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:30.580
别给我添麻烦  面谈结束
Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.

01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:33.380
我若出狱  绝不提你的事
Sir, if I were to ever get out, I would never mention what goes on in here.

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.990
因为洗钱  与你同罪
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:41.790
不许你提钱这个字  混账东西
Don't ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch!

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.660
办公室里不许提
Not in this office.

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.800
到哪里都不许提  来人！
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:48.730
我只是想让你放心  没别的意思
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease, that's all. Sir, I...

01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:51.460
-小号  一个月  -是  长官
-Solitary. A month. -Yes, sir.

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:54.440
-你是怎么搞的？  -带走
-What's the matter with you? -Get him out of here.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.200
这是我重获自由的机会  我的人生转机  你不懂？
This is my chance to get out! Don't you see that? It's my life! Don't you understand?

01:33:58.410 --> 01:34:00.470
-带出去  -这是我的人生转机
-Get him out! Get him out! -This is my life! No!

01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:04.220
小号  一个月
A month in the hole.

01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:07.110
从没听过这么严厉的惩罚
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.620
都是我不对
It's all my fault.

01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:10.410
胡说八道
Oh, bullshit.

01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:13.790
你没杀人  也没判安迪的罪
You didn't pull the trigger and you certainly didn't convict him.

01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:16.390
你是说安迪没罪？
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.620
他真的无辜？
I mean, for real innocent?

01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:20.160
看来是这样
It looks that way.

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:22.500
我的天
Sweet Jesus.

01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:24.600
他服刑多久了？
How long's he been here now?

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.270
-47年进来  19年了  -19年……
1947. What is that? 19 years. -19 years...

01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:31.100
-汤米的信  -我在这
-Williams, Thomas.  -Yeah, over here.

01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:35.500
-爱德华·帕克森  -在这
-Paxon, Edward. -Yeah.

01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:38.110
是什么？
What you got?

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:40.080
教育委员会来的
Board of Education.

01:34:40.290 --> 01:34:42.360
-老小子寄出那考卷了  -看来是
-That son of a bitch mailed it. -Looks like he did.

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:45.980
你是要拆开  还是就这么拿着傻看？
Are you gonna open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?

01:34:46.190 --> 01:34:48.350
拿着傻看好些
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:51.700
把它还给我  你他妈的
Hey, Skeet, come on, give me that, you shithead.

01:34:52.530 --> 01:34:53.860
-福洛  -这边
-Floyd, come on. -Over here, over here!

01:34:56.670 --> 01:34:58.030
瑞德
Hey, Red!

01:34:59.310 --> 01:35:01.710
把它丢掉  好吗？
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:09.040
狗屎  不赖
Well, shit.

01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:24.530
他通过了  平均丙上
The kid passed. C + average.

01:35:24.730 --> 01:35:26.820
跟你报个喜
Thought you'd like to know.

01:35:43.050 --> 01:35:44.540
典狱长找你谈话
The Warden wants to talk.

01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.320
在这儿？
Out here?

01:35:59.530 --> 01:36:01.760
他就是这样说的
That's what the man said.

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:18.870
典狱长？
Warden?

01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:20.750
汤米？
Tommy.

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:32.960
汤米  这次会面你要保密
Tommy... I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.

01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:36.730
我良心深感不安
I feel awkward enough as it is.

01:36:55.190 --> 01:36:57.250
他的判决出了问题
We got a situation here.

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.220
我想你明白
I think you can appreciate that.

01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:01.650
是的
Yes, sir.

01:37:01.930 --> 01:37:03.330
我明白
I sure can.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.620
这件事真使我震惊
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.

01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:11.660
我连觉都睡不好
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:15.770
我该怎么做才好
The right thing to do.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.170
有时连我也搞不清楚
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:23.610
能理解吗？
You understand?

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.510
我需要你的协助  孩子
I need your help, son.

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.120
我要有……
If I'm going to move on this,

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:34.620
十足把握才能翻案
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.420
我得知道
I have to know...

01:37:36.630 --> 01:37:39.260
你所说是否实话
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:40.590
是的
Yes, sir.

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.030
字字属实
Absolutely.

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:45.530
你愿在法官及陪审团前宣誓
Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury,

01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:47.730
并且手按圣经
having placed your hand on the Good Book...

01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:50.600
在上帝跟前起誓吗？
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:52.610
只要给我这个机会
Just give me that chance.

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.210
我也这样想
That's what I thought.

01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.200
相信你已听说了
I'm sure by now you've heard...

01:38:48.970 --> 01:38:49.990
真惨
A terrible thing.

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.090
年纪轻轻
A man that young,

01:38:53.410 --> 01:38:56.000
刑期剩下不到一年还要逃
less than a year to go, trying to escape.

01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:59.030
射杀他令海利伤透心
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.270
千真万确
Truly, it did.

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.720
我们只有忘掉这事
We just have to put it behind us.

01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:09.620
继续过日子
Move on.

01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:12.710
到此为止
I'm done.

01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:15.650
我不干了
Everything stops.

01:39:17.630 --> 01:39:19.960
你找别人帮你骗钱吧
Get someone else to run your scams.

01:39:21.230 --> 01:39:23.070
一切照旧
Nothing stops.

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:25.560
一切
Nothing.

01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:32.070
否则我要你生不如死
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.780
不再让警卫保护你
No more protection from the guards.

01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:39.920
不再让你一人一间牢房  把你丢到鸡奸狂当中
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton and cast you down with the Sodomites.

01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:43.750
日日夜夜轮奸不休
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:46.650
图书馆呢？
And the library?

01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:48.320
没了
Gone.

01:39:48.930 --> 01:39:51.490
用砖头封死
Sealed off, brick by brick.

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:54.630
在操场焚书
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:56.960
几英里外都看得见火光
They'll see the flames for miles.

01:39:57.170 --> 01:40:00.000
大家围着火跳红蕃舞
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:04.270
听懂了吗？
You understand me? Catching my drift?

01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:09.880
我是笨蛋吗？
Or am I being obtuse?

01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:24.290
再关他一个月  考虑清楚
Give him another month to think about it.

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:14.100
老婆说她很难了解我
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:16.750
像一本合起来的书
Like a closed book.

01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:19.580
她整天这样抱怨
Complained about it all the time.

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.080
她很漂亮
She was beautiful.

01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:26.010
我那么爱她
God, I loved her.

01:41:29.730 --> 01:41:31.960
我只是不擅表达
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.360
是我杀了她
I killed her, Red.

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:40.030
枪不是我开的
I didn't pull the trigger.

01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:43.200
但我害她离我远去
But I drove her away.

01:41:44.710 --> 01:41:47.410
是我的脾气秉性
That's why she died, because of me.

01:41:47.610 --> 01:41:48.980
害死了她
The way I am.

01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:59.820
但你不是杀人犯
That don't make you a murderer.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.960
只能说是差丈夫
A bad husband, maybe.

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:11.870
可以忏悔  但你无罪
Feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.

01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:13.400
没错
No, I didn't.

01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:15.740
别人干的
Somebody else did.

01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:19.070
却由我受罚
And I wound up in here.

01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:23.140
大概是我命薄
Bad luck, I guess.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.900
是的
Yeah.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
谁都可能
It floats around.

01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:33.050
沾染霉运
It's got to land on somebody.

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.860
刚好轮到我
It was my turn, that's all.

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.330
我被卷入龙卷风
I was in the path of the tornado.

01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:49.230
只是没想到刮了这么久
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.

01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:55.270
你有可能假释吗？
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:57.540
我？
Me?

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:01.510
有吧
Yeah.

01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:05.150
要等我老得须发花白
One day, when I got a long, white beard...

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:09.450
神智不清才行
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs, they'll let me out.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.190
我跟你说我要去哪儿
I tell you where I'd go.

01:43:13.670 --> 01:43:15.330
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo.

01:43:13.670 --> 01:43:19.530
芝华塔尼欧（Zihuatanejo），墨西哥西南部的一座城市，
其名在纳瓦特尔语中为“女人之地”，因为该地在古代是母系社会，
该市因《肖申克的救赎》而声名大噪。

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.400
哪里？
Zi...what?

01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.530
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo.

01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:22.130
在墨西哥
It's in Mexico.

01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:25.640
太平洋边的小地方
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:30.720
-知道墨西哥人怎样说太平洋的吗？  -不知道
-You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? -No.

01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:33.380
那是没有回忆的海洋
They say it has no memory.

01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:38.020
我要在那度此余生
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:42.150
没有回忆的温暖地
A warm place with no memory.

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:47.330
在海边
Open up a little hotel,

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.530
开个小旅馆
right on the beach.

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.330
买条破船
Buy some worthless old boat,

01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:55.500
整修一新
and fix it up new.

01:43:58.240 --> 01:43:59.470
载客出海
Take my guests out.

01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:01.680
包船海钓
Charter fishing.

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:07.250
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo, huh?

01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:14.660
你在那地方也大有可为
In a place like that, I could use a man who knows how to get things.

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:24.030
我在外头吃不开的
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

01:44:30.710 --> 01:44:32.770
我一生都耗在肖申克
I been in here most of my life.

01:44:34.210 --> 01:44:35.980
我已经体制化了
I'm an institutional man now.

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.610
就像老布
Just like Brooks was.

01:44:40.090 --> 01:44:41.780
你别小看自己
Well, you underestimate yourself.

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:43.950
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:47.290
我是说
I mean...

01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:51.730
在牢里  我让你有求必应
In here, I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure. But...

01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:55.020
一进社会  电话簿里样样有
outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

01:44:55.230 --> 01:44:57.460
但我连查都不会查
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

01:44:59.610 --> 01:45:01.230
太平洋？
The Pacific Ocean?

01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.870
狗屁
Shit.

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:05.440
大得我心都毛了
About scare me to death, something that big.

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.940
我不会
Not me.

01:45:08.150 --> 01:45:10.910
老婆和她情夫不是我杀的
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:15.880
我犯的错已还清
Whatever mistakes I've made, I've paid for them and then some.

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:18.410
一间旅店  一叶扁舟
That hotel, that boat.

01:45:20.190 --> 01:45:22.420
要求并不过份
I don't think that's too much to ask.

01:45:27.330 --> 01:45:29.770
你不该生此妄想
I don't think you ought to be doing this to yourself, Andy.

01:45:29.970 --> 01:45:31.990
就像下水道里冒出的臭梦
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.930
墨西哥和这儿
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there and you're in here.

01:45:35.110 --> 01:45:36.670
天南地北
And that's the way it is.

01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:39.840
说的没错
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:43.750
远隔天涯海角
It's down there and I'm in here.

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.050
我猜是人就得二选一
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.450
要么忙着活……
Get busy living...

01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:56.850
要么忙着死
or get busy dying.

01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:01.660
安迪
Andy.

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:06.530
瑞德
Red.

01:46:08.970 --> 01:46:11.700
等你假释后  帮我个忙
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:14.180
没问题  你说
Sure, Andy. Anything.

01:46:16.050 --> 01:46:19.920
巴克斯顿有个大草场  知道巴克斯顿吗？
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?

01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:24.520
-那一带草场多得很  -有一处与众不同
-Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there. -One in particular.

01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:28.660
那里有长石墙  北端还有大橡树
It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.

01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:31.730
罗伯特·弗罗斯特，美国诗人，
素有“新英格兰诗人”之称，其诗朴素无华，舒畅自然。
《桦树》节选——
“我真想离开人世一会儿
回来后再重新开始。
愿命运不再故意误解我
然后部分地成全我的希望，把我迅速
拿开而不送回。人世是个适合爱的地方：
我不知道还要去哪里会更好。
我会爬着一棵桦树而去，
从黑色的树枝攀爬到那向着天空的雪白
树干，直到那树已不再能够承受我，
并弯下自己的树梢再次把我送回来。
不管是离去还是返回我都会愉快。”

01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:31.730
美得像弗罗斯特的诗
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:35.160
我在那儿向她求婚
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

01:46:36.570 --> 01:46:38.660
我们去野餐
We went there for a picnic...

01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:41.160
在橡树下做爱
and made love under that oak.

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:44.070
我开口  她首肯
I asked and she said yes.

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:49.910
答应我  瑞德
Promise me, Red.

01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:52.380
如果你终获假释
If you ever get out,

01:46:52.590 --> 01:46:54.080
去找到那个地方
find that spot.

01:46:55.250 --> 01:47:00.090
石墙底下有一块奇石
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

01:47:01.230 --> 01:47:04.250
黑色火山玻璃石
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

01:47:06.930 --> 01:47:09.590
底下埋着给你的东西
There's something buried under it I want you to have.

01:47:10.370 --> 01:47:11.600
是什么？
What, Andy?

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.770
你埋着什么？
What's buried under there?

01:47:15.370 --> 01:47:17.240
你搬开它
You'll have to pry it up...

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.710
就知道了
to see.

01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:26.550
你们听我说
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:28.950
他胡言乱语
He's talking funnier.

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:31.750
我真担心他
I'm really worried about him.

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.590
我们要盯紧他
We ought to keep an eye on him.

01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:37.060
白天不要紧  晚上孤伶伶的
That's fine during the day, but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:39.620
天哪
Oh, Lord.

01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:42.560
怎么了？
What?

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:46.070
安迪今天到载货区
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:48.370
问我要一条绳子
He asked me for a length of rope.

01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:51.270
-绳子？  -六英尺长
-Rope? -Six feet long.

01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:52.880
你给了他？
And you gave it to him?

01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:55.540
为什么不给？
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:59.680
-天啊  赫伍  -我怎么想得到？
-Jesus, Heywood. -Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

01:48:00.090 --> 01:48:01.640
你忘了老布？
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:05.590
不  安迪不会寻短
No. Andy would never do that.

01:48:06.190 --> 01:48:07.250
绝对不会
Never.

01:48:09.330 --> 01:48:10.660
谁知道呢？
I don't know.

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.520
人的忍耐是有限度的
Every man has his breaking point.

01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:20.130
动作快  我要回家
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.200
马上好了
Just about finished, sir.

01:48:39.330 --> 01:48:40.950
今晚要存三笔
Three deposits tonight.

01:48:48.930 --> 01:48:50.830
把衣物送洗
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:52.660
把鞋擦亮
And shine my shoes.

01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:55.810
-要擦得雪亮  -是
-I want 'em looking like mirrors. -Yes, sir.

01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:02.800
你回来真好  安迪
It's good having you back, Andy.

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:05.580
没有你可差多了
The place wasn't the same without you.

01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.520
熄灯
Lights out!

01:50:26.370 --> 01:50:28.890
我也曾熬过孤寂长夜
I've had some long nights in stir.

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.100
独自在心中思东想西
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts,

01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:34.970
时间慢得如同刀割
time can draw out like a blade.

01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:43.300
那是我毕生最长的一夜
That was the longest night of my life.

01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:00.320
清点人数！
Give me a count!

01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:08.640
-南三层到齐  -北四层到齐
-Tier 3 south, clear! -Tier 4 North. Clear.

01:51:09.110 --> 01:51:10.400
北三层到齐
Tier 3 North. Clear.

01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:13.970
二层245没人
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:15.240
杜弗伦
Dufresne!

01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:18.220
快出来 别耍花样
Get your ass out here, boy. You're holding up the show.

01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:24.750
等我找上门  可就重赏你的脑袋了
Don't make me come down there. I'll thump your skull for ya!

01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:36.170
该死  我还得等你一个  你敢耽搁我时间
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.

01:51:36.370 --> 01:51:39.670
你最好是病了或是死了
You'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!

01:51:39.870 --> 01:51:41.200
听见没有？
You hear me?

01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:49.410
噢  我的上帝
Oh, my Holy God.

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.960
这一分区每人都要问
I want every man on this cell block questioned.

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:11.960
-先从他朋友开始  -谁？
-Start with that friend of his. -Who?

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:13.540
他
Him.

01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:16.100
打开237
Open 237.

01:52:19.610 --> 01:52:23.270
什么叫“他不见了”？  这算什么鬼话？
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me, Haig.

01:52:24.150 --> 01:52:25.480
你再说一次试试
Don't say that to me again.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:26.710
但他真的不见了
But, sir, he wasn't.

01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:30.410
我没长眼睛吗？
I can see that, Haig! You think I'm blind?

01:52:31.090 --> 01:52:32.490
你是这个意思？
Is that what you're saying?

01:52:32.690 --> 01:52:35.350
-我眼瞎了？  -不敢  长官
-Am I blind, Haig? -No, sir!

01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:38.750
你呢？ 你瞎了吗？
What about you. Are you blind?

01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:41.820
-你说这是什么？  -昨晚的点名记录
-Tell me what this is. -Last night's count.

01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:45.330
上面明明写着杜弗伦
You see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. See? Right there.

01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:46.870
“杜弗伦”
"Dufresne."

01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:50.030
熄灯时
He was in his cell...

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:51.270
他在牢里
at lights out.

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:54.380
早上应该也在才对
It stands to reason he'd still be here in the morning.

01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:56.340
把他找到
I want him found.

01:52:56.550 --> 01:53:00.010
一刻不能拖  现在就找！
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

01:53:00.250 --> 01:53:01.450
是  长官
Yes, sir.

01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:06.250
搜人去  快点
Let's go, let's go! Move your butts! Move it!

01:53:08.130 --> 01:53:09.120
站好
Stand.

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:11.620
你说
Well?

01:53:15.070 --> 01:53:16.060
说什么？
Well, what?

01:53:16.270 --> 01:53:19.730
你们俩成天粘在一起
I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.

01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:22.300
他一定说过什么
He must have said something.

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.570
报告典狱长
No, sir, Warden.

01:53:24.910 --> 01:53:25.900
没有
Not a word.

01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:30.310
那真是奇迹了
Lord, it's a miracle!

01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:33.480
人像屁一样凭空消失
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

01:53:34.150 --> 01:53:35.310
不见踪影
Nothing left...

01:53:36.150 --> 01:53:38.880
只剩一堆石头
but some damn rocks on a windowsill.

01:53:39.090 --> 01:53:41.820
还有墙上那骚货  问问她吧
And that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.

01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:43.790
也许她知道些什么
Maybe she knows.

01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:46.760
你来说  短裤妞儿
What say there, Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.500
她不会说的
Ah... I guess not.

01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:52.260
别人不说  为何她要说
Why should she be any different?

01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:55.000
没错  你们有预谋
This is a conspiracy.

01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:57.470
就是这样
That's what this is.

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:01.810
一个超级大阴谋
One big, damn conspiracy!

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:04.070
每个人都有份
And everyone's in on it!

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:05.880
包括她
Including her!

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:42.610
1966年
In 1966,

01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:45.220
安迪·杜弗伦逃离……
Andy Dufresne escaped...

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:46.980
肖申克监狱
from Shawshank Prison.

01:54:49.230 --> 01:54:51.790
狱方只寻获泥渍囚衣
All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes,

01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:53.960
一块肥皂
a bar of soap...

01:54:54.170 --> 01:54:55.720
和一把石锤
and an old rock hammer...

01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:58.430
一把几乎解体的石锤
damn near worn down to the nub.

01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:07.680
我曾夸口要花六百年才能挖通的隧道
I remember thinking it would take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:10.940
安迪花了不到20年
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

01:55:29.230 --> 01:55:31.530
他喜爱研究地质
Oh, Andy loved geology.

01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:35.470
碎石令他想一探究竟
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:37.710
刑期如同
An ice age here,

01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:40.630
冰河时代
a million years of mountain-building there.

01:55:41.650 --> 01:55:44.480
地质学探讨压力及时间
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:47.310
这就是凿通的关键——
That's all it takes, really.

01:55:48.050 --> 01:55:49.150
压力
Pressure...

01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:51.050
时间
and time.

01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:54.450
和一张够大的海报
That and a big goddamn poster.

01:55:58.260 --> 01:55:59.420
就像我说的
Like I said,

01:55:59.930 --> 01:56:03.920
在牢里  没事也得找事做
in prison, a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.

01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:11.540
原来安迪的嗜好  就是把他的牢墙
It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:14.010
一次一把地搬到操场上
A handful at a time.

01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:17.370
大概就在汤米死后
I guess after Tommy was killed,

01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:20.550
安迪决定不再久留
Andy decided he'd been here just about long enough.

01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:23.310
动作快  我要回家
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:26.080
马上就好
I'm just about finished, sir.

01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:49.480
今晚要存三笔
Three deposits tonight.

01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:59.090
安迪奉命行事
Andy did like he was told.

01:56:59.290 --> 01:57:02.780
把鞋子擦得雪亮
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:08.760
警卫都没注意
The guards simply didn't notice.

01:57:09.070 --> 01:57:10.560
我也没有
Neither did I.

01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:12.260
说真的
I mean, seriously,

01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:15.460
谁会注意别人的鞋子
how often do you really look at a man's shoes?

01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:22.190
安迪就这样爬向自由
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...

01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:25.770
在恶臭中匍匐五百码
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

01:59:26.770 --> 01:59:29.100
换我才不干呢
Or maybe I just don't want to.

01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:35.880
五百码
500 yards.

01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:39.440
有五个足球场那么长
That's the length of five football fields.

01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:42.650
接近半英里
Just shy of half a mile.

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:42.470
次日清晨  在拉寇儿坦露她的秘密之时
The next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her little secret,

02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:45.610
一个从未现世的人
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...

02:00:45.850 --> 02:00:48.440
走进缅因国家银行
strode into the Maine National Bank.

02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:52.180
在那之前  他不是实体
Until that moment, he didn't exist,

02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:53.920
只存在于文件上
except on paper.

02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:55.120
有何贵干？
May I help you?

02:00:55.530 --> 02:00:57.460
他各种证件都有
He had all the proper ID,

02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:01.360
驾照  出生证  社会保险卡
driver's license, birth certificate, social security card.

02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:04.330
签名分毫不差
And the signature was a spot-on match.

02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:07.630
失去您的生意令我真心遗憾
I must say, I'm sorry to be losing your business.

02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:09.570
祝您侨居愉快
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:11.470
谢谢
Thank you.

02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:13.300
一定
I'm sure I will.

02:01:14.210 --> 02:01:17.550
这是银行本票  就这样吗？
Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?

02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:18.740
麻烦你
Please...

02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:21.810
帮我寄出去好吗？
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.510
乐意之至
I'd be happy to.

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:26.650
-再会  -走好
-Good day, sir. -Good day.

02:01:27.590 --> 02:01:32.030
那天上午史帝文先后去了波特兰一带将近十二家银行
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.

02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:34.090
总共加起来
All told, he blew town...

02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:39.130
提走了诺顿37万美金
with better than $370,000 of Warden Norton's money.

02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:42.600
作为十九年冤狱的补偿
Severance pay for 19 years.

02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:52.040
早上好  这里是《波特兰号角日报》
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:54.060
肖申克监狱发生贪污谋杀

02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:55.690
肖申克监狱发生贪污谋杀

02:01:55.690 --> 02:01:56.490
肖申克监狱发生贪污谋杀

02:02:02.770 --> 02:02:05.360
主 的 审 判

02:02:02.770 --> 02:02:05.360
即  将  降  临

02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:23.720
亲爱的典狱长

02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:23.740
你说得对

02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:23.740
救赎之道 就在其中

02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:25.020
亲爱的典狱长

02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.020
你说得对

02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.020
救赎之道 就在其中

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:30.700
典狱长最后打开安迪的《圣经》时，发现安迪用来挖隧道逃走的石锤，
就藏在从“出埃及记”开始往后的那些页里，该章讲述的是犹太人逃出埃及的故事。

02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:47.840
你是海利吗？  你有权保持沉默
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.

02:02:48.110 --> 02:02:52.540
从现在起  你所说的一切  都将可能成为呈堂证供
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say will be held against you in court.

02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:57.440
当时我没有在场  后来听说
I wasn't there to see it. But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing like a little girl...

02:02:57.650 --> 02:02:59.140
海利被人带走的时候  哭得像个娘们儿
when they took him away.

02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:08.420
诺顿却无意乖乖就范
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:25.740
塞缪尔·诺顿
Samuel Norton.

02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:28.340
我们有拘捕令  开门
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:31.880
诺顿
Norton!

02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:34.180
把门打开
Open the door.

02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:35.980
我不清楚是哪一把
I'm not sure which key it is.

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:39.580
诺顿
Norton!

02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:48.330
别自找麻烦  诺顿
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:03.040
我猜他脑中最后一件事
I like to think the last thing that went through his head,

02:04:03.250 --> 02:04:04.840
除了枪子儿
other than that bullet,

02:04:05.050 --> 02:04:09.490
就是在想安迪为何能整倒他
was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

02:04:10.290 --> 02:04:11.880
詹姆斯·卡特
Carter, James...

02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:15.450
典狱长呜呼后不久
Not long after the Warden deprived us of his company,

02:04:15.730 --> 02:04:17.790
我收到一张明信片
I got a postcard in the mail.

02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:22.100
没写字  但有邮戳
It was blank, but the postmark said...

02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:24.430
来自德州汉考克堡
Fort Hancock, Texas.

02:04:24.970 --> 02:04:26.330
汉考克堡
Fort Hancock.

02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:28.330
就在边境线上
Right on the border.

02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:30.730
安迪就是从那里出境的
That's where Andy crossed.

02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:35.440
驾着敞蓬车驶向南方
When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down,

02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:38.010
想到这画面就令我开怀大笑
it always makes me laugh.

02:04:39.850 --> 02:04:41.410
安迪·杜弗伦
Andy Dufresne,

02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:43.810
爬过肮脏的下水道
who crawled through a river of shit...

02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:46.420
出来已焕然一新
and came out clean on the other side.

02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:48.620
安迪·杜弗伦
Andy Dufresne,

02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:51.020
向太平洋驶去
headed for the Pacific.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.160
海利掐住他喉咙说
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

02:04:56.370 --> 02:05:00.170
“他活的不耐烦了。”
And he says, "I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."

02:05:00.370 --> 02:05:03.240
老友们常聊起他
Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.

02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:05.600
他那些惊人之举
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:08.300
“请我朋友喝啤酒吧……”
"These friends of mine could use a couple of beers!"

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.770
-他真的做到了！ -真就做到了！
-And he got it. -And he got it!

02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:14.420
有时我会感伤
Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

02:05:14.690 --> 02:05:16.120
他的离去
Andy being gone.

02:05:16.820 --> 02:05:18.020
我不得不提醒自己
I have to remind myself that...

02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:19.950
有些鸟儿是关不住的
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:23.490
它们的羽毛太鲜亮了
Their feathers are just too bright.

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:26.930
当它们飞离时
And when they fly away,

02:05:27.370 --> 02:05:31.770
你会由衷欣慰它们重获自由
the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:34.100
无奈的是
But still...

02:05:34.570 --> 02:05:38.910
你得继续在这乏味之地苟活
the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.

02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:45.480
这么说或许出于我对这位友伴的怀念
I guess I just miss my friend.

02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:11.100
请坐
Please sit down.

02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:18.510
埃利斯·博伊德·瑞丁
Ellis Boyd Redding.

02:06:19.050 --> 02:06:22.320
根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满40年
Your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.

02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:25.250
你改过自新了吗？
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

02:06:27.130 --> 02:06:28.680
改过自新？
Rehabilitated?

02:06:30.730 --> 02:06:32.630
噢  让我想想
Well, now, let me see.

02:06:33.630 --> 02:06:35.960
我不大明白这个词的含义
You know, I don't have any idea what that means.

02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:40.330
就是说准备好重返社会
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:43.240
我当然明白你的意思  年轻人
I know what you think it means, sonny.

02:06:45.410 --> 02:06:47.400
对我而言  这只是个虚词
To me, it's just a made-up word.

02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:51.080
政客发明的词
A politician's word so that...

02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:55.040
好让你们穿西装打领带
young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie...

02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:57.110
有活干
and have a job.

02:06:59.090 --> 02:07:01.180
你到底想了解什么？
What do you really want to know?

02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:03.930
我后悔犯罪吗？
Am I sorry for what I did?

02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:05.520
你后悔吗？
Well, are you?

02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:10.270
我没有一天不后悔
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:15.090
但并非因为关在这里  也不为讨好你们
Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.

02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:21.140
回首前尘往事
I look back on the way I was then.

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:24.440
那个
A young...

02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:29.040
犯下重罪的小笨蛋
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:33.750
我想跟他谈谈
I want to talk to him.

02:07:35.690 --> 02:07:38.180
想给他讲一些感受
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

02:07:38.900 --> 02:07:40.830
给他讲冲动酿下的苦果
tell him the way things are.

02:07:42.930 --> 02:07:44.370
但我办不到
But I can't.

02:07:46.570 --> 02:07:48.560
那个少年早就不见了
That kid's long gone.

02:07:49.770 --> 02:07:52.540
只剩下我垂老之躯
This old man is all that's left.

02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:55.440
我得接受事实
I gotta live with that.

02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:58.480
改过自新？
Rehabilitated?

02:07:58.850 --> 02:08:00.680
狗屁不通的词儿
It's just a bullshit word.

02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:06.390
盖章吧  别浪费我的时间
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time.

02:08:07.630 --> 02:08:09.890
跟你说句实话吧
Because to tell you the truth,

02:08:10.230 --> 02:08:12.220
我他妈的不在乎了
I don't give a shit.

02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:26.800
批      准

02:09:21.330 --> 02:09:26.060
老布
到此一游

02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:40.150
你的  小姐
Here you go, miss.

02:09:43.090 --> 02:09:44.110
可以上厕所吗？
Rest room break, boss?

02:09:49.930 --> 02:09:54.460
别一小解就来报告  要去就去  懂吗?
You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:57.090
是
Yes, sir.

02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:10.570
我报告了40年
40 years I've been asking permission to piss.

02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:14.410
不报告  一滴也挤不出
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:20.080
我得面对一个残酷的事实
There's a harsh truth to face.

02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:24.660
在狱外我根本混不下去
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:36.230
我一心想违犯假释
All I do any more is think of ways to break my parole...

02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:39.530
也许就能重返肖申克
so maybe they'd send me back.

02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:47.150
活在恐惧中真是糟糕
A terrible thing to live in fear.

02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:49.710
老布体会过
Brooks Hatlen knew it,

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:51.860
他看透了
knew it all too well.

02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:56.860
我只想回到有意义的地方
All I want is to be back where things make sense,

02:10:57.300 --> 02:11:00.030
不必整天担惊受怕
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:04.400
只有一件事阻止了我
Only one thing stops me.

02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:08.240
我向安迪做过承诺
A promise I made to Andy.

02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:29.890
到了
There it is.

02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:42.170
非常感谢您
Much obliged, sir.

02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:50.200
巴克斯顿

02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:53.560
巴克斯顿

02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:57.580
巴克斯顿

02:15:21.490 --> 02:15:22.750
“亲爱的瑞德：”
Dear Red,

02:15:22.990 --> 02:15:25.480
“见到这封信的时候，你已经出狱了。”
If you're reading this, you've gotten out.

02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:29.720
“既然走了这么远的路，干脆再走远一点吧。”
And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.490
“你还记得那个地方的名字，是吗？”
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

02:15:34.770 --> 02:15:36.260
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo.

02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:41.500
“请来帮我实现计划，”
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.

02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:45.540
“我备妥棋盘等着你。”
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.

02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:47.750
“记住，瑞德，”
Remember, Red,

02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:50.180
“希望是美好的，”
hope is a good thing,

02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:52.380
“也许是最好的，”
maybe the best of things,

02:15:52.590 --> 02:15:54.750
“而美好之物，永不消逝。”
and no good thing ever dies.

02:15:55.290 --> 02:15:58.160
“希望这封信，能让我再次见到你，”
I will be hoping that this letter finds you...

02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:00.090
“一个健在的你。”
and finds you well.

02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:01.830
“你的朋友，”
Your friend,

02:16:38.970 --> 02:16:40.870
“要么忙着死。”
or get busy dying."

02:16:43.570 --> 02:16:45.740
这话真他妈的精辟
That's goddamn right.

02:16:46.090 --> 02:16:50.050
也来过

在踏上远征那一刻  才会生出这种
A free man at the start of a long journey...

02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:25.870
